,Car Seat Headrest,Teens of Style,Matador,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention," is not technically Car Seat Headrest’s debut, but a greatest hits, a career retrospective, a rarities comp, and a remix album all rolled into one. In the last five years, frontman and band mastermind Will Toledo has been churning out a steady stream of music, recording first in his family car and later in his dorm room at Virginia Commonwealth University. Before signing to Matador Records, he had released via Bandcamp 11 albums of original tunes, an output that approaches that of his hero, Robert Pollard. For his proper debut, Toledo re-recorded 11 older songs, fleshing out fairly skeletal arrangements to create towering monuments to indie rock. The result sounds like both the closing of one door and the opening of another.These songs sprawl in ways they never did before, in ways they never  before, but what’s astonishing is just how much detail and nuance Toledo gets out of the lo-fi setting. His band layers chiming power-pop post-punk guitars, thrumming synths, and intricate Beach Boys harmonies to say something essential about millennial angst. Especially given its lyrical shout-outs to Michael Stipe and Matador Records exec Chris Lombardi, among other insiders, the whole thing could have sounded purely academic—the sound of a young man playing to his record collection. Instead,  explores the ways that our favorite music and our biggest heroes can serve as conduits to the larger world, and Toledo sings like he can’t wait to provide that experience for others. —Stephen M. Deusner

,Elysia Crampton,American Drift,Blueberry,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Is it cheesy to say that Elysia Crampton’s  feels like the type of art that belongs in a gallery? Unlike most of contemporary music’s quick thrills, this album is a pastiche that seems more in line the work of a super exciting young painter, like , who makes massive portraits of messed-up people, or maybe the kooky set builders , who literally built a meth lab for people to walk around in. Like the most aggressive pursuers of the weirdly beautiful, this heady producer infuses ponderance and pleasure into her work through the simple fact of its literal and spiritual enormity. crushes genres as it piles on disparate elements: Lil Jon samples, cumbia rhythms, deeply reverent freeform poetry. The album’s funkiness is almost secondary to the fun of just listening to its many parts bob and weave through the baseline of electronic ambience. The Bolivian-born artist uses her singular sonic vocabulary to reflect a world that is breathless and difficult while wrestling with the many threads culture creates.  feels like an attempt to illustrate —but instead of boiling the universe down to one complete thought, Crampton sploshes around paint and then scratches at its layers until she’s got a strange and delightful canvas. —Matthew Schnipper

,Dâm-Funk,Invite the Light,Stones Throw,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Damon Riddick (aka Dâm-Funk) is both a traditionalist and an innovator. On , he enlists a 1970s funk original (Junie Morrison of the Ohio Players), a G-funk hip-hop legend (Snoop Dogg), and a new-age psychedelic eccentric (Ariel Pink) for the same tracklist. It’s all in the name of breaking ground in familiar land. In the lead  for , Riddick caresses a keytar in a smoky room as his refrain turns over on itself: ""We continue."" It's a thesis. Taken at face-value, Dâm-Funk might seem like a revivalist mining a decades old aesthetic, but instead of a carefully executed schtick, his music is revelatory: funk is timeless, and evolving. And he has an inimitable knack for conjuring it up. —Jay Balfour

,Dej Loaf,#AndSeeThatsTheThing EP,Columbia,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"""Damn I’m so little but I’m feeling like Shaquille,"" Dej Loaf raps on the chilly opening to her brisk , and rarely has an artist offered a statement of purpose as efficiently. This is the rare major-label rap debut that delivers on the promise of an Internet phenom without compromise. Radio hit ""Back Up"" with Big Sean churns a Detroit electro sample into a bristling self-affirmation anthem, but it’s the guarded moments of tenderness that linger, from a duet with Future to ""Butterflies"", which is more like a spacey dream-pop ballad than a rap song. Dej is easy to root for because her writing is so forthright and frank, and on this sweet, short EP, she nails her entire dynamic in just six songs. —Matthew Ramirez"
,DJ Paypal,Sold Out,Brainfeeder,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"If Rimsky-Korsakov’s ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" were a footwork track that was part , part , it would basically be the title track of . Like the rest of DJ Paypal’s mini-album, ""Sold Out"", is a testament to the elasticity of footwork as much as it is to his genius.In November, the Berlin-based, North Carolina-born Teklife producer dropped this EP, his most adventurous and emotionally incisive work to date, as well as first-ever footwork release on Brainfeeder. Throughout the record, DJ Paypal layers in '70s-era soul vocals, twizzling jazz sax lines, chintzy synths, and bubbling . And he makes it sound like he’s beaming it in from an alternate universe, one accessible only to a Chosen Few. On the exuberant-turned-manic ""Slim Trak"", West African tam-tams punch through chants stacked so high they threaten to collapse in on themselves. ""On a Cloud"" sounds like vocoder aliens equipped with arcade lasers and the singular mission to get faded.It's been an important year for footwork, in part because it’s been the first full year without Teklife founder and big brother, DJ Rashad. Many producers   a heightened sense of duty to do right by the man, to work towards fill the gaping hole he left behind. And so, they’ve been turning it out. DJ Paypal, along with his generation of younger footwork peers like Jlin, DJ Earl, DJ Taye, and some of his own tongue-in-cheek Mall Music crew, all dropped EPs or albums this year. Footwork legends RP Boo and DJ Spinn did as well. It’s fitting then that  closes with a track called ""Say Goodbye"", which could easily be read as an adieu to Rashad. It’s an expansive, skies-wide-open track, a shimmery unfurling of memory and longing. —Minna Zhou

,DJ Richard,Grind,Dial,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"DJ Richard’s  is  gone techno. Yes, many of these songs have a consistent beat suitable for dancing (or at least nodding your head), but they just as frequently drift off into the abyss. This is a loose, unhurried album that works best when processed as one clump of electronic music with micro-movements and moods. For example, halfway through the song ""Vampire Dub"", gentle '90s IDM textures are suddenly accompanied by an extremely aggressive drum—the kind of wet, heavy snare a metal band would use—but it only lopes along, a trope of hardness that never turns particularly mean. The drum leaves, comes back, leaves again. It’s like the aural equivalent of someone who has a very important point to make but keeps forgetting it. There’s a beautiful charm to listening to all this unfold. It could have been a messy jumble of thoughts, but instead it’s a sneak peek into a busy, bright brain, working it all out on his own time. —Matthew Schnipper"
,Downtown Boys,Full Communism,Don Giovanni,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"In concert, Downtown Boys command all of your attention. The Providence, R.I.-based punk sextet is intense, combustible, and overflowing with conviction. It’s risky to check out and gaze at your phone, lest you wind up clobbered by a flailing saxophonist. They have the kind of energy that’s difficult to recreate on a recording—their music is an experience dependent on the band, but also the feedback and presence of an audience. So, it’s a relief that on their debut record, , Downtown Boys still sound and feel like themselves. Recorded at Chicago’s Electrical Audio and produced by the band alongside Don Giovanni label-head, Joe Steinhardt,  documents the band’s raw, weird energy with little in the way of embellishment or refinement. There’s no getting around it: Downtown Boys are an earnest band. But despite their passions, they never register as smarmy. Part of the joy of being a Downtown Boys fan is bearing witness to a group of people with such a level of enthusiasm and conviction—about politics, about noise-making, and about community. Even on their cover of Springsteen’s 30-year-old hit ""Dancing in the Dark"", Downtown Boys seem like they’re 100% in the moment. —Aaron Leitko"
50,Pusha T,My Name Is My Name,Def Jam / GOOD,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"At a time in pop music where immediacy counts more than ever, Pusha T’s official debut album got pushed back so many times that it had started to become the rap-world shorthand for a project left to die on the shelf. But instead of becoming a liability, ’s repeated delays ended up becoming an advantage. Pusha’s bluntly unadorned flow has always been best suited to skeletal arrangements (revisit the decade-old “Grindin’” if you need a vivid reminder), so  dropping into the thick of a craze for minimalist rap worked out pretty well for him. As one of the more ardent affiliates of Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music crew, it’s not surprising that the album shares some of ’ stark sonics, but the beats are more comfortably luxurious. With so much experience working with stripped-down sounds, Pusha has become a master of making a lot out of very little. Push never oversells his songs, but listen through enough times and you start uncovering the wealth of subtle hooks it has hiding in plain sight. —Miles RaymerPusha T: "
49,Julia Holter,Loud City Song,Domino,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"""Try to make yourself a work of art/ Like me,"" sang Julia Holter, the experimental L.A. pop singer, on her debut record, the one based on an ancient Greek play. This year's  is the first Holter record to be made outside of her bedroom, but compared to that early sentiment, it feels especially external. The album is based on the 1958 Parisian musical , but was also inspired by Holter's life in the city—it is set distinctly within the context of the urban pastoral, conjuring the ambient noise of a bustling metropolitan area through swarming horns, or images of patrons walking on the streets with a cool-sung cabaret piece.  thus feels big, alive, and more ambitious than anything Holter has done, working with free jazz instrumentation of trombones, strings and double bass to explore a new sense of theatricality. One of her most miraculous talents is how she takes these high concepts and keeps them inviting and unpretentious while still requiring valuable patience and a certain steadiness of mind to appreciate the record as one full, cohesive, and uplifting piece. —Jenn Pelly
"
,A$AP Ferg,Trap Lord,Polo Grounds / RCA,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"In the second verse of the rain-soaked  ""Fergivicious"", A$AP Ferg shrugs his shoulders and sighs: ""I feel the pain for my bro 'cause his dad died/ My daddy gone too my nigga, that's life."" In Ferg's world, empathy nurtures, but survival dictates you look out for yourself first, even if it requires you to treat your father's death with a brusque matter-of-factness. If that makes the lively  sound like a bummer, it's because Ferg's mixtape-turned-debut album never lets you forget the dark underbelly of the world he came from. ""Hood Pope"" has him making the song cry with a melodic slow flow while ""Cocaine Castle"" echoes with the pained cries of infants, prostitutes on the verge of overdosing, and souls that Beelzebub has ensnared.But Ferg's plenty versatile, so bangers abound too. Breakout hit ""Shabba"" only shines brighter as time passes; ""Lord"" invites Bone Thugs-N-Harmony to a thunderstorm séance, each member trying to resurrect the dead with breathless cadences; even ""4:02"", the sex jam, is suffused with a melancholy that gives it a woozy, uncomfortable quality, as if the walls are slowly closing in. For all its oddities—and  is a album, equal parts homeless-dude prophet-speak and demonic-ritual soundtrack—the spotlight always resides squarely on Ferg, even when guests take center stage. He understands that you can do just as much damage from the sidelines if you get in people's brains. That voice in your head? That's Fergivicious. —Renato Pagnani

,Burial,Rival Dealer EP,Hyperdub,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"This was a strong year for what we once called electronic listening music and it was interesting how many new records came from familiar names that cross over from the experimental community: Tim Hecker, the Field, Julianna Barwick, Boards of Canada, Four Tet. All we needed to round it out was a new Fennesz record—or a new Burial, which we got, last week, in the form of , another stealth 12"" release in what is quietly become a run of classic EPs. Like the aforementioned artists, Burial has an instantly recognizable sound, but it’s shocking how much he has been able to do with it, that he can retain his core vibe and texture while making music that varies wildly in structure and intent.  is typically gorgeous on the surface, with the usual array of ghosted voices, vinyl crackles, ominous synths, and a subtle but powerful sense of melody. But Burial has never sounded this hectic or intense at one end and this lush and meditative on the other, and there’s a deeper emotional undercurrent running beneath.Since the record’s release, Burial’s William Bevan has released a statement that sheds light on sample threads that run through the record, some of which feature quotes about sexual identity and being who you are and rising above. ""I wanted the tunes to be anti-bullying tunes that could maybe help someone to believe in themselves,"" Bevan’s note read, ""to not be afraid, and to not give up, and to know that someone out there cares and is looking out for them.”  is an extended EP of glorious extremes and there in the middle are the listeners, wrapping themselves in sound, living inside Burial’s world for a moment while thinking about the one outside. —Mark RichardsonBurial: "
,Fetty Wap,Fetty Wap,300 Entertainment,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"No one had the run Fetty Wap had in 2015: After ""Trap Queen"" blew the doors open, he placed three songs simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100 chart—a rare feat usually associated with established names like Lil Wayne and Eminem—and nabbed  spots on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart, an unprecedented accomplishment in the 26-year history of that list. His eponymous  pulls off an equally uncommon task by maintaining the maximal exuberance of those hits for more than an hour. The self-contained record shares a similarity in execution to Waka Flocka Flame’s career-defining 2010 salvo , where the creative spring of a single mind is extracted and bottled for eternity in one full-length package. Fetty’s raps are the perfect alchemy of clumsy and charming, which might be an issue if most of the songs didn’t deliver hooks at this rampant a clip—17 songs with 17 unassailable choruses in a row. Fetty could retire now and he’d still have an all-time run, and an all-time hip-hop debut record to boot. —Matthew Ramirez"
,Girlpool,Before the World Was Big,Wichita,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Girlpool's  bursts with the pressure of its own fragility, the duo of bassist Harmony Tividad and guitarist Cleo Tucker singing sweet melodies to each other while steadily plucking at their instruments, harmonizing to the heavens. It's the sound of two best friends navigating uncharted territory, walking down their street ""a hundred million billion trillion times,"" as depicted in the title track. It sounds like learning to cook in your first apartment, or realizing you're the age your parents were when they first met. The best albums are the ones that give way to the creation of a self-contained world, every note in its rightful place. By boiling their songs down to their bare essence, Girlpool have achieved just that. —Cameron Cook

,Hop Along,Painted Shut,Saddle Creek,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"The wiry, bookish sound of  will endure as long as MFA candidates pick up guitars, and Hop Along are at their vanguard. ""By the time it’s old/ My face will have been seen/ And I’ll share a very/ Common poverty/ It’s a very common kind,"" Frances Quinlan sings on ""Waitress"", a vignette about a disgraced diner server. It’s the only guitar-rock lyric I heard this year that reminded me of Italo Calvino’s description of ""habitual faces, whose features the bar mirror has watched thicken or sag,” for certain, and Hop Along spend all of their stellar third album leaping to capture these specific sorts of honors.Quinlan’s rough voice always sounds on the verge of giving out, but as a writer she is a tender guardian who sees dignity everywhere she looks: On ""The Knock"", she is moved to tears by the beaming Jehovah’s Witness who knocks on her door (""I never once seen a teenager look so radiant""), and ""Buddy in the Parade"" recalls the spectacular public breakdown of early-20th century cornetist Charles ""Buddy"" Bolden, who started frothing at the mouth during a parade performance and spent the rest of his life in a sanitarium. The songs are furiously angry in their energy and endlessly compassionate toward their targets, backing you into a corner and hugging you fiercely, like someone staging a very determined intervention on your behalf. —Jayson Greene"
48,Speedy Ortiz,Major Arcana,Carpark,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"singer/guitarist Sadie Dupuis’ syrup-and-snake-venom inkwell overflows with here-and-now urgency, as does the whole album’s spring-loaded tenseness. “Tiger Tank” strikes a harrowing harmonic itch that Dupuis’ vocal melody circles but refuses to scratch, and “Gary” lurches between darkness and dawn like a synesthesia-stricken vampire. “Plough”, on the other hand, is a singsong cipher that pits pop hooks against pinprick riffage and a disorienting falsetto trill that taunts logic. Nirvana’s  celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2013, but  is the real celebration—as well as the overdue prompt to mutate or die. —Jason Heller
"
47,The Range,Nonfiction,Donky Pitch,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"James Hinton’s debut as the Range, , came out of nowhere. What it did not do was come out of nowhere to floor you, knock you backward, or slap you in the face. The effect was more like the polite dosey doe you dance when bumping into a stranger. ""Oh, um."" ""Heh."" ""Sorry."" ""Yep.""  will pass without incident if you let it, but it managed to graze many of the year's trends—a re-exploration of grime, of breakbeats, and of drum & bass—while maintaining its personality and isolation. Sampladelic music is rarely so self-contained. The interjecting voices—mostly anonymous grime MCs—don't feel like conversations but footnotes, references to outside texts.  pilfers many of its samples from deep-crate YouTube clips, but the album avoids commenting on technology or media consumption. Hinton mined the service like you would a zine, a pirate radio station, or any other mercurial broadcast that feels like it's beamed directly to you: by internalizing its strangeness and mimicking its appeal. —Andrew Gaerig

46,M.I.A.,Matangi,Interscope,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Let's have a brief moment of stock-taking: 2013 is a year in which Jay Z is recording advertisements for smartphones and Kanye West is recording minimalist industrial rap as means of revenge against the fashion industry. The two men duking it out for the title of Soul King are both white, and the de rigeur style of rapping is… singing. Beyoncé is on track to sell a record number of an album she didn't even promote. Who could blame Maya Arulpragasam for making an album that feels a bit ?  sounds like M.I.A.'s spiritual side picked a fight with her inner rebel, her inner rebel slapped back and then they cracked up about it and hopped in bed to create a record full of humor. Amidst the grimy lurch and clatter of these beats—her best since —is a rare, relaxed version of M.I.A. saying some truly left-field, whimsical stuff. She's making fun of Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft; she's rattling off lines like, ""there's 36 Chambers in my Wu-Tent,"" and, ""my blood type is no negative""; she's singing her own loopy, off-key version of a bedroom jam over a Weeknd beat and calling it “Sexodus”. And for once, everyone else is making her seem relatively normal. —Carrie BattanM.I.A.: "
45,Fuck Buttons,Slow Focus,ATP,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Fuck Buttons’ debut, 2008's , featured distorted, near-black-metal vocals along with the expansive, low-tech electronics, letting the listener know there were humans in the room. Then came 2009's , a less duct-taped collection that found Benjamin Power and Andrew Hung disappearing a bit into the background, exploring electronic music more head on without entirely tightening the seams. Four years later, they offered up their self-produced third album, , a finely polished collection that matches the shiny decadence of the jewels on its cover. It's also the moment Fuck Buttons removed their fingerprints entirely from the equation, giving us alien, otherworldly sounds to mull over with less noise-rock mediation. And it's a revelation. The music’s as muscular as ever, it's just more efficient—maximalist minimalism?—and no matter how many times you listen to these seven tracks, you discover previously unlit corners. Unlike the past compositions, there's no levity or moments to catch your breath: Each song's pile of colorful synthesizers and deep, dark percussion adds up to a go-for-broke anthem, and they obviously haven't reached their limit. The way the duo's learned to layer and accrue detail, you get the sense that these whirling, pulsing pieces could snowball endlessly, growing larger and more beautiful each second, blowing off the roof only to diagram the sky. It's cool songs from  were played at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Too bad this wasn't ready for it. —Brandon Stosuy

,Against Me!,Transgender Dysphoria Blues,Total Treble,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"In high school, Against Me! were the most credible band anyone I knew might know, punk iconoclasts spitting fiery songs about anarchy, DIY, revolution—topics that feel essential when you’re a teen. Well, you can guess what happened next: deals with major labels, seemingly unbounded promise unfulfilled, and parts of a fanbase left behind to cry ""sell out!"" as the band (which swiftly shed original members) began to re-examine the ethos that brought them here. In 2010, they acknowledged their failures on , emphasis on the past tense: ""Do you remember/ When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?"" That those lines came on a milquetoast major-label album escaped no one’s attention.Then, they found something new to scream about. In 2012, singer Laura Jane Grace came out as transgender, and, to general surprise, pointed out how some of the band’s earlier music had hinted at—but never fully explored—her gender dysphoria. On , she was free to sing without obfuscation. Grace’s voice has long been one of rock'n'roll’s massively emotive battering rams, and she’s never sounded more unbridled. Against Me! were always best when proffering a firm hand in an uncertain society—their punk songs are love songs, built for comfort in times of crisis. Over blood-churning guitars and galvanizing hooks, Grace gives her love to unnamed trans women bearing the brunt of callous discrimination, and to her wife, Heather, who must navigate this journey along with her. That love might not be enough—Grace knows from experience—but it’s there for the taking, kindling for the fire. ""There’s a brave new world that’s raging inside of me,"" Grace sings on ""FUCKMYLIFE666"", which combines insouciant rebellion—just look at the title—with bracing, poetic uncertainty about this next phase of her life.It’s an autobiographical album, not a concept album, insistent and uncompromising, sung by a trans woman for trans listeners without any filtering or translation. That’s genuinely revolutionary, in ways that punk bands simply fixated on anarchy rarely are. So despite the ""live fast, die young"" history of the genre, Against Me! is a punk band making their most necessary album as they approach 20 years of existence. (The kids I knew in high school never would’ve predicted that.) As Grace told  in 2012, when  was only in the works: ""However fierce our band was in the past, imagine me, six foot two, in heels, fucking screaming in someone’s face."" Consider that promise finally fulfilled. —Jeremy Gordon

,Lydia Ainsworth,Right from Real,Arbutus,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,", a collection of two EPs released earlier this year, is a revelation of a debut: stunning, fully-formed, suffused with wintry atmosphere, sonically omnivorous yet cohesive. As a female singer-songwriter whose palettes are artpop and synth-pop, the comparisons come fast and inevitable: one-time labelmate Grimes (the comparisons end there), the avant-pop likes of Julia Holter, and, of course, Kate Bush—in particular, and of all things, Bush’s . Yet Ainsworth’s vision is singular. ""Candle"" is an orchestral piece blown to bits by a backmasked digital gust. (If Ainsworth has a characteristic trick, this is it.) ""Moonstone"" periodically sounds about to turn into a Purity Ring song at half-speed, but settles as an otherworldly almanac of words and sounds. ""Malachite"" is the kind of gothy synthpop dozens of more seasoned artists have failed to get this gloriously right. ""Take Your Face Off"" doesn’t seem like it should work, swooping through cello gloom, R&B melisma, sunsoaked keyboard lines, and twitchy synth lattices, it evokes Tori Amos (in a couple places, Ainsworth channels near-exactly some Amos inflections that aren’t that common), Dawn Richard (another doppelgänger, in her low range and songwriting ambition) and the Art of Noise (directly  in the drifty midsection). And, somehow, it all coheres. It’s intricate enough to reward close listening and immediate enough in its pleasures to sound astonishing from listen one; during its best moments,  is breathtaking in the best way: the way where you didn’t know music could do this. —Katherine St. Asaph

50,Ben Frost,A U R O R A,Mute / Bedroom Community,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Ben Frost puts a lot of thought into his music, technically and conceptually. His song titles and interviews pack his dense, throbbing scrawls with allusions to everything from biochemistry to . This is somewhat ironic, as the main capacity of his music is to overwhelm rational thought. It registers in the limbs and viscera, not in the mind. On , mostly recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Frost mostly jettisons the guitars and classical instruments of prior albums, though standout deep cut ""Sola Fide"" does sound like a catastrophic collision between chamber music and a rave. Instead, he doubles down on heavy synths and heaving drums courtesy of powerhouses such as Greg Fox (Liturgy), Thor Harris (Swans), and Shahzad Ismaily. The result has a rough but elaborate physical presence—something huge and shuddering running on filthy kerosene, about to snap a belt or throw a bolt and maim the operator. But Frost is never overpowered by his brawny, chaotic material. However strong it is, his will is stronger, and gales of distortion bend to his command with clarity and definition. His prior marquee album, 2009’s , was excellent but less single-minded in its pursuit. This is the one that really grabs you and doesn’t let go. —Brian Howe

49,Mr Twin Sister,Mr Twin Sister,Infinite Best / Twin Group,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Lots of indie bands have mined the giddiness and sexual empowerment of the disco era, but few have tapped into the cultural fracture that followed it. The language of identity crisis is all over Mr Twin Sister’s second album, right down to the fact that they added a ""Mr"" to their name for this self-released sophomore effort (and then named the album after their newly christened selves).  is slicker, sexier, a little more concerned with mortality (the band endured a serious van accident in 2013), and the quintet’s lyrics often chase several possible threads: On ""Out of the Dark"", singer Andrea Estella declares that ""I am a woman, but inside I’m a man, and I want to be as gay as I can!"" A minute later, she looks back and wonders: ""What ever happened to poor, dear me?”Mr Twin Sister are also adept at following the trickle-down of commonalities between house, electro, and new wave (especially on ""Rude Boy"", which suggests a shared lineage with Tom Tom Club’s ""Genius of Love""). And like any honest survey of nightlife music, 's high highs (""In The House of Yes"", ""Twelve Angels"") are followed quickly by low lows (""Blush"", ""Crime Scene"")—the two sides of the same airy fantasy. —Abby Garnett

,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,Push The Sky Away,Bad Seed Ltd.,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Nick Cave must have the weirdest browser history imaginable. For , he found lyrical inspiration in the stranger corners of the internet, writing songs based on Googling curiosities and absurdist autocompletes. The result is the anti-, an embrace rather than a rejection of technology’s poetic possibilities. It’s also an outlier in Cave’s catalog, with lyrics full of fever-dream imagery: Robert Johnson, Hannah Montana, mermaids. Meanwhile, the Bad Seeds turn down their fire-and-brimstone drama. Their first album without founding member Mick Harvey, is aggressively subdued: quiet, but good lord, not mellow. On songs like “We No Who U R” and “Water’s Edge”, the music coils tightly around Cave’s vocals as if the band might pounce at any moment. They never do. Instead, they sustain that fraught atmosphere across the album’s nine tracks, which climax with the eight-minute Geneva-to-Memphis-to-Taluca-Lake road trip “Higgs Boson Blues”. That there is no moment of release, no sense of catharsis, no space to take a breath only makes sound pricklier, like a link you can’t unclick. —Stephen DeusnerNick Cave and the Bad Seeds: "
,Classixx,Hanging Gardens,Innovative Leisure,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Having evidently taken their career notes from a hipster bingo card (bloghouse edition), California’s Tyler Blake and Michael David got their start on the internet remix circuit (check) where they refit a couple of tracks under the Bowie-nodding (yup) moniker Young Americans. After re-christening themselves as Classixx, the pair commissioned some Kraftwerk-inspired (uh huh) artwork and made , an album that goofily samples everything from Fleetwood Mac (tick) to Tears For Fears (tick tick) over the course of its 12 tracks. I know, I know. But what looks like pure troll bait on paper is actually irresistible on wax. One of those classic sleeper records that neither astonishes nor offends,  spends the whole afternoon locked in third gear. With vocals from a smattering of guest stars such as LCD Soundsystem’s Nancy Whang and Active Child, and a judicious mix of summer-ready singles (of which Whang’s “All You’re Waiting For” is the finest) and knowing deep cuts, this is one of those poolside records that not only transcends the genre of bubblegum disco but also the adversity of its own cliché. —Mark Pytlik

,Mikal Cronin,MCII,Merge,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"If anybody made a better rock record for car stereos this year, I didn’t hear it—probably because was stuck in my disc-changer all summer. Mikal Cronin makes the creation of strummy, jangly, shout-along songs seem as easy and natural as opening a window and letting the breeze whip past your steering wheel. But writing songs as consistently winning and tuneful as those found on is far from easy—if it was, Cronin would not have so swiftly established himself as the best songwriter currently working in the loosely defined garage rock milieu. Lyrically, Cronin veers between joy and despair—he has enough “Peace of Mind” to “Shout it Out” one minute, and then wonders “Am I Wrong” and pleads “Don’t Let Me Go” the next. As a young, sensitive guy, he’s predictably mixed up. But as a fountain of punky power-pop hooks, Cronin is all confidence. —Steven Hyden

,Death Grips,Government Plates,self-released,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Having descended into a PR hell of cancelled gigs and no-show pranks that left many sour, how could Death Grips push themselves forward? By going all in on the self-obliterating aural-suicide angle, as they do on . Death Grips' fourth full-length is divided into two parts: There's everything leading up to “Birds”, which smashes the lines between IDM, noise, hip-hop, and raw rock. Then there's everything “Birds”, which takes those smashed conventions and fashions something even more unrecognizable and unfuckwithable from them. Little of the technique drummer Zach Hill's been lauded for remains, and even fewer natural percussion sounds are are present. Who misses them? Stefan “MC Ride” Burnett, meanwhile, provides an argument against lyricismhis intonation is a weapon, even if you can't understand what he's saying.

,Grouper,The Man Who Died in His Boat,Kranky,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention," is Liz Harris’ most beloved album, marking the moment when her hushed ballads could be most clearly discerned in their twilit surroundings.  consists of songs recorded around the same timea time when Harris was “sick with depression and solitude”and with much the same means. But far from a collection of inferior castoffs, these songs are easily the equal of their exquisite predecessors. Built mostly from acoustic guitar and Harris’ sleep-heavy voice, they tap into a sense of the sublime and the poetic vastness of the North American landscape. And yet Harris’ America is internal, a psychological landscape fogged with dream-matter and liable to shift and roil like the surface of a cloud. There is something timeless about this particular heartstring being plucked: It doesn’t get old. So while Harris has gone back to more abstract work since 2008the A I A series, and has rounded out this year with a range of divergent collaborative projects, this period of her output will probably retain its special radiance for a long time to come. “I often picture releasing an album as trying to secretly sink a heavy object in a lake,” Harris said in an  earlier this year. “Find a quiet corner, gently slip it under the surface, watch the ripples for a moment, and steal away.” —Angus Finlayson

,Tim Hecker,Virgins,Kranky / Paper Bag,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Tim Hecker’s discography has traced such a steady incline, it’s sometimes tough to describe how one album differs from the last—other than the fact that it’s better. But with , there are some clear deviations. It’s the first record Hecker made primarily with live instruments, many played by his colleagues in the  collective. It’s also his most spacious-sounding work—those instruments, especially the vibrating woodwinds, get tons of room to breathe—as well as his most classically minimalist, filled with repetitions that echo the phase innovations of .More importantly, there’s a forceful, near-violent thrust to much of , marking it more of a career reset than a logical step forward. Hecker sounds continually ready to fight, or at least unwilling to retreat. Part of that comes from the refreshing shock of hearing actual clacks from keys and puffs from horns. And part comes from the sheer bluntness of his attack: Every sound, even the softer ones, rushes in. Thus the literally titled “Live Room” cycles through myriad tones and moods without ever losing its urgent grip, while “Virginal II” makes simple chords sound like bullets from a machine gun. If that sounds like a call to arms, that’s because Hecker’s still a soldier. He could’ve just reported for duty and come up with something good, but  shows he’s still out to win both the battle and the war. –Marc Masters

,Hiss Golden Messenger,Haw,Paradise of Bachelors,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"The music M.C. Taylor makes as Hiss Golden Messenger defies easy description.  is his best record thus far and the most fitting example of just how difficult and confusing it is to nail him down; it’s like Bonnie “Prince” Billy and R. Kelly bailed on the  and just got in the studio together.  is rootsy, containing all of the instruments you’d associate with a folk-rock record, but also full of orchestral flair. It’s got its feet in country, its mind in pop. It’s laid-back but obsessed with detail. It’s an album flecked with brightness that’s mostly about death and full of Bible allusions. On “Sufferer (Love My Conquerer)”, Taylor spins a tight web of soulful vocal runs and imaginative instrumentation, establishing the album's pulse. It’s like all the radio stations on your AM dial melted into one mutant signal, funk and gospel and preacher’s chatter all bleeding into Taylor’s folk. —Corban Goble

50,Dawn Richard,Blackheart,Our Dawn Entertainment,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"At once vast, inventive, unfashionably earnest, and rapturously liberated,  is a stunning personal statement from Dawn Richard. Recorded around the time of her grandmother’s death and father’s cancer diagnosis, as well as the demise of her former band Danity Kane, the album is deep and raw, emotionally epic even in its sonic plateaus. Its genre-busting scope is also a form of catharsis, coming from a 31-year-old industry vet who is finally her own boss (not to mention manager, , and publicist). ""Blow"" pledges to ""Forget this modest shit/ We taking all of it"". The beats, co-produced with Noisecastle III, are a revelation, sending R&B spinning into any and all nearby galaxies. ’s sounds are ambitious not just in breadth and scale (though highlights ""Calypso"", ""Warriors"", and ""Castles"" are staggering by any metric) but in their detail, too. As ""Projection"" simmers down, ambient afterthoughts swing in and out of earshot in parabolic arcs: Synths undulate, Björk-ish vocals teem, woodwind flutters, shutters flicker. Though it’s part two in a slated trilogy,  feels like the completion of an artistic vision. —Jazz Monroe

49,Natalie Prass,Natalie Prass,Spacebomb,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"What made Natalie Prass’  stand out from the seemingly endless pile of Authentic American Roots Music wasn’t how real it felt, but how artificial. Like Elvis in Hawaii or a leather sofa with a plastic slip cover, Prass and her collaborator Matthew E. White’s blend of '70s soul, variety-show country, and music theater is a perpetual mixed signal. Gritty one minute and detached the next, it's confessional in subject matter but brittle, even chilly, in delivery. The façade is moving in part because of the occasional ways it cracks. Take ""Christy"" (""a name that isn’t too short or too sweet… Christy""), a song Prass says she wrote as a study on the idea of the Other Woman but didn’t register until a few years later, when the song happened to her. All from a former teenage  who once had an epiphany about the majesty of life while dressed as a werewolf and staring at the moon. Sometimes it only takes a whisper to say how you really feel; sometimes it takes a hundred flutes. —Mike Powell"
44,Justin Timberlake,The 20/20 Experience,RCA,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Just like Jon Hamm's ""bubble""-encased Drew Baird character on ""30 Rock"", we let Justin Timberlake get away with so much. His 2013 started strong (we'll get to that in a moment) but his bit part in an excellent Coen Brothers movie was overshadowed by a leading role in one of the worst major studio films of the year (trust me, I saw it), not to mention an album that managed to offend domestic abuse survivors  HBO viewers in one fell swoop. His most fervent admirers (trust me, I'm one of them) could only hide their eyes with embarrassment. ""I'm not cut out for it,"" Timberlake bitterly complained about the avalanche of late-year criticism to  in a piece titled ""#Hashtag of the Year"", a confirmation of his ubiquity in the face of all odds. A resolute showman who spent the first phase of his nearly two-decade career facing constant scrutiny, it can sometimes seem that Timberlake's main goal isn't to be —it's to be .""Drink You Away"" be damned, though, Justin Timberlake continues to be liked (, by many) and the first volume of  provides plenty of reasons why. Sure, just writing down some of the album's most notable conceits—the best nü-metal deep-cut weeper since Limp Bizkit covered the Who, a power ballad about looking at yourself in the mirror, the only Michael Flatley-meets-Miami Sound Machine mashup you ever need to hear—might suggest that a few pairs of Bad Idea Jeans were worn in the studio. And yet, along with Timbaland and J-Roc (who were more or less left for dead after that embarrassing ""electronic"" Chris Cornell album), Timberlake ended up with one of the year's most enjoyable pop records, a document of endless musical largesse that earns its 70-minute runtime with lush sonics and a moony-eyed fixation on monogamy so hopelessly corny that it ends up coming across as totally endearing. It's disappointing that Justin Timberlake didn't put out two great albums in 2013, but as hindsight (har har) suggests, that one of them ended up being very good is nothing short of a miracle. —Larry FitzmauriceJustin Timberlake: "
43,The National,Trouble Will Find Me,4AD,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"The National couldn’t have been more out of step with 2013’s pop-worshipping zeitgeist. As the hippest of the hip in indie-rock circles tripped over themselves to pay homage to Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake, here was a band steadfastly committed to the thankless task of delivering excellent National albums. It’s tempting to take for grantednow that the National is a couple of records removed from its “beloved underdog” period. On previous records like and the National staked its claim as the preeminent chroniclers of office-bound and apartment-confined urban drone-ism. These guys are Springsteen for people named Dylan and Skylar who worry about their 401K’s going bankrupt like Frankie and Mary fretted about the factory shutting down. On the National faced the challenge of maintaining this creative momentum as it entered the band’s middle age, and responded with a record imbued with similar uncertainties about what happens to life once it starts to slow down. The fear of loss—whether it’s the loss of love, security, or a sense of  purpose—haunts this record, sometimes literally (like on “Demons”, which invite Matt Berninger to “stay down”) but mostly figuratively (like on the amazing “Pink Rabbits”, where a drunk still pines for a woman who has long since forgotten him). might not have bowled listeners over when it came out in May, but for many of us it continued to linger, as National records do, revealing new truths and soothing old wounds, an out-of-step record perfectly suited for out-of-step listeners. —Steven Hyden"
42,Rhye,Woman,Republic / Innovative Leisure / Loma Vista,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Anonymity made for a perfect introduction to the elegantly minimal soul confections of Rhye, the duo of singer Mike Milosh and producer Robin Hannibal. It sharpened the peculiarly acute intimacy of absence, which is the softly beating heart swaddled in the gentle instrumental folds of Rhye’s debut, . Hannibal’s tracks have a priceless offhanded grace, whipping the warmest, lightest froth from creamy pianos and synths, saucy horns and slinky basses, and effervescent drums popping off cushiony strings. The smooth, porous strains let Milosh’s multitracked voice, a thin and chilly slip that moves as lightly as a hummingbird, penetrate deeply. Milosh inhabits his highest range as freely as most of us chitchat, and while he’s not a demonstrative singer, he’s precise. Saccharine and sexy, bold and timid, it’s hipster R&B for xx rather than R. Kelly fans; a point of view distinct from Jamie Woon’s techno-leaning existential angst or the Weeknd’s dark, strident drive. The heartbreakingly lovely “Open” blossoms in a lush bouquet of Vivaldi-like strings, glowing brass and scintillating harp before a sax licks out as the spongy bass line drops, and Milosh flows out of his wordless hum and starts to bounce. He sounds so authentically beatific that I long misheard “Mmm, but stay” as “Namaste,” and it totally worked. Beyond a dazzling opening stretch including “The Fall” and “Last Dance”, deep cuts like “One of Those Summer Days” extend the quiet storm into stately oceanic depths. “Don’t call me love unless you mean it,” goes an indelible refrain tucked amid the feathery disco-funk of “Shed Some Blood”, which perfectly sums up the coquettish blend of tenderness, sensitivity, and insolence that sets Rhye apart. —Brian HoweRhye: "

He doesn’t divulge many other details about what he went through, but here’s what we know: He quit his job in Boston and moved in with a friend in St. Louis. There, he wrote songs about what he’d been going through, which makes  Lee’s therapy. His lyrics are economical, beautiful, and sometimes crushingly sad. They tell stories, but the characters are faceless and the details are vague. There are bursts of semi-specifics, like the line on “Golden Wake” about Lee quitting his job. “That Light That’s Blinding” paints the portrait of someone sweating out toxins, feeling like dying, and, yes, seeing a blinding light. “I couldn’t stop it from washing over you,” Lee sings to his struggling loved one.He worked for months to envelop his words with warm, gorgeous string arrangements, and he dotted everything with field recordings: wind chimes, creaking floors, the flicker of a lighter, the sound of kids’ toys, and the muted twinkle of an old piano. Lee moved around a lot while working on , collecting the small bits of sound that pop up throughout the album. His nomadic inclinations also turn up in his lyrics: “I’m on the slow train rollin’ through that city,” he sings. While traveling, he looks inward, singing, “My mind is muddled, our hearts are empty, my body seems so temporary.” It’s a fragile album with delicate sonic dressings. On the first and last track, Lee sings that “the river only knows to carry on.” The phrase seems to embody two related ideas: Trauma is inevitable, but letting go and moving forward is paramount. —Evan Minsker

,Bing & Ruth,Tomorrow Was the Golden Age,Rvng Intl.,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention," is the crown jewel in an amazing 2014 for New York’s .—a stellar year where the label looked to the past as well as the future. The most precious record to come out of it seems to exist in some limbo between the two. Classified as ""ambient"" by default, Bing & Ruth’s first album for the label is hardly electronic. It’s something more old-fashioned than that: the sound of a septet of musicians, directed by pianist David Moore, who exercise a masterful sense of control so serene that it hardly seems human. That’s the trick: They tend to move as one unit rather than individual players, and their compositions develop gradually like small waves lapping at the shore, inching closer and closer to high tide until the whole landscape is blanketed. Using tape delay as their only production flourish, the ensemble blurs the lines between past and present, playing new notes over echoes of the old ones. That kind of technique might sound simplistic, but the massive sense of space lends the album an almost church-like majesty. And, in its own way,  is a devotional. A collection of wordless hymns written not for religious ends but rather as paeans to the beauty of the wider world itself—a world that looked uglier than ever in 2014— is the sort of powerful record that has the ability to shift your mood, and maybe even your perceptions. —Andrew Ryce

,Container,Adhesive,Liberation Technologies,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"Ren Schofield's carcinogenic techno-noise project Container sounds like a lot of different things, but nothing you'd call conventionally pleasing. On this year's thrillingly nasty  EP, you get thudding beats locked into slavish motorik rhythms, decked out in all the hallmarks that make the most unforgiving machine music so delectably debilitating. The static-shocked drums sound as if they've been coated in an oxidizing agent, while singed electronic flourishes recall bundles of frayed wires being dunked in chemical waste and various metals screech and scrape against each other. On ""Glaze"", you can almost make out the sputtering croak of some unholy piece of reanimated hardware repeating the word ""demon."" But holy shit, does this thing bounce. There's an addictive buoyancy to the tracks that, despite their grating insistency, suggests that Schofield might have created them to actually get people to move. At the same time, he seems like the only guy on earth capable of playing a masonry saw and making it sound funky. Sneak one of 's four throbbers into a dance mix and, placed ever so delicately, the people will embrace every serrated gesture. Like a hunk of meat barbecued within an inch of its threshold, there's juice and glistening ribbons of fat underneath the scorched, crackling surface. —Zach Kelly

48,Clark,Clark,Warp,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"In a year full of social and political upheaval, you have to wonder about the role of electronic music in the grand scheme. Being largely instrumental, the genre isn't exactly primed to deliver clear and direct messages outside of its own context, let alone fiery missives or storm-bringing manifestos for a general populous to rally around. But electronic music can still serve vital purposes during tumultuous times of desperation and discontent. Perhaps most readily, it can provide a much needed escape for our troubled minds, though it can also reflect the boiling unrest within our hearts. Chris Clark's self-titled seventh album, 45 minutes of vivid atmosphere and controlled chaos, managed to do exactly both. —Patric Fallon

47,Shellac,Dude Incredible,Touch and Go,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014," is an honest representation of gifted musicians playing punk rock together with patient breath and coiled abandon. The bass, drums, guitar, and vocals each end up being showcased on their own at various points on the album, and each might rightly be described as the ""lead"" instrument; the songs are magnanimous and co-operative because, after more than 20 years of making records together, the seasoned team managing them trusts each other like brothers. The lyrics, often presented in unaffected, tuneful speech or guttural screaming, convey incisive, comedic, and thoughtful ruminations on the following: human interaction and behavior; fighting; vandalism; political machinations and opportunistic/piss-poor leadership; looking at things and being looked at by things; and at least one dispute about the conclusion of an instance of sexual intercourse. To paraphrase a line from the title track, all of Shellac’s records are fit, but some of them are spectacular.  is definitely the latter—a lean batch of nine intriguing, blood-pumping songs that tromp, clatter, and ring out like nothing else ever could. —Vish Khanna"

It sounds like the intergalactic equivalent of whale song—the indecipherable cries of beings that are beyond us in every sense. Whether sloughing off creaky music-of-the-spheres drones or rubbing your face in filthy, overdriven drum and bass—less breakbeat science than breakbeat slagheap—Stott's latest, bleakest album has a way of making you feel very, very small.

Mostly performed live with a labyrinthine modular synth setup and visual programming language Max/MSP, and inspired by the “sprawling inventive madness of the 60s and 70s,” these tracks read like grubby paeans to Holden’s  forefathers, or synthetic re-imaginings of bygone pagan rituals. Yes, there are nods to the producer’s dancefloor rootsin the boisterous “Renata”, saybut they’re outnumbered by the moments of bracing abstraction: the weird fractal squiggles of “Gone Feral”, “Sky Burial”’s muzzygrandiosity, decaying Cluster homage “The Illuminations”.

,Inter Arma,Sky Burial,Relapse,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Inter Arma is by no means a new band, but given the feverish din surrounding the Richmond quintet’s first Relapse Records release, you’d be forgiven for thinking so. They’ve actually been honing their craft since 2006, and 2013’s  represents a massive evolutionary leap. Many reviews have mentioned the careful and introspective nature of its eight songs, but it’s also imperative to note just how commanding this record can be: sees the band buzzing with restless energy and spoiling for a fight. The imperial march that opens “The Survival Fires” strides through barren valleys and dusty plains. The forlorn acoustic wildness of “Love Absolute” surges forwards into the climactic title track, a bluesy, black metal-cum-Neurosis-inspired epic that hinges upon both the psychedelic and the desperately raw.  is an anomaly in its range and power, and a blueprint for the shape of extreme music to come; its lows are mere depressions, and its windswept highs soar high into uncharted territory and rarefied air. —Kim Kelly

48,Shamir,Ratchet,XL,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"It'd be fine if all Shamir Bailey had going for him was the virtuosity of his voice—his countertenor is capable of subdued softness and piercing force in equal measure. But it's the place that voice is coming from, and the people it's built to connect with, that brings  to light as something more than just a hell of a performance.Shamir is an outsider with a lot of territories to be outside of. He was raised in a tourist city that he depicts in the deceptively bubbly leadoff cut as more of a temporary destination than a permanent home (""Vegas""), simultaneously living through and numbed to the social connections of party culture (""Make a Scene"", ""Hot Mess"") as he carries a binary-rejecting genderqueer identity. So his only recourse is to stand defiant with a voice that shuns the simplicity of macho posturing for razor-witted shade (""On the Regular""). That perspective is essential to his songs' insight, a wide-scope view that makes the emotions that drive his desire the great equalizer. There's a lot of ambivalence, guilt, and fear in his music, whether he's letting a relationship corrupt him (""Demon"") or fighting through the repercussions of it all to try and come out stronger in the end (""Call It Off""). With producer (and former Pitchfork contributor) Nick Sylvester warping versatile post-Jaxx house into immediate pop and R&B,  is one of the best albums in recent memory that damn near anyone can get psyched up—or introspective—to.

46,Tobias Jesso Jr.,Goon,True Panther,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"""Hollywood"", the centerpiece of Tobias Jesso Jr.’s debut album , offers a cautionary tale to those enraptured by bright lights, huge billboards, and glistening walks of fame. ""Think I’m gonna die in Hollywood,"" sings Jesso, who spent some of his twenties haplessly trying to become a big time pop songwriter in Los Angeles, dreaming of working with his favorite artist, Adele. It is a somber song about failure, written by a guy coming to terms with his own youthful illusions.So it’s more than a little ironic that ""Hollywood"" caught Adele’s ear earlier this year, causing her to enlist Jesso to write for her record-busting new album. If Jesso’s unlikely redemption story was the plot of an actual Hollywood film, it would be tough not to call bullshit. But at the same time, considering the plainspoken glories of , his breakthrough makes a certain kind of cosmic sense. Jesso’s years as a wannabe songwriter weren’t fruitless after all: along with supplying some character-building roadblocks, they helped him hone a durable, open-ended technique. Throughout the album, he tackles subjects that know no expiration date—desire, heartbreak, betrayal—with arrangements and melodies that Paul McCartney could covet. As if to test the foundations of ’s songs, Jesso and his jazzbo live band spent the year showing off dramatically revamped renditions in styles ranging from reggae, to dixieland, to metal, to funk. Indeed, these shameless musings of a lovelorn fool hold up quite well. Some Hollywood stories never get old. —Ryan Dombal"
45,Jim O'Rourke,Simple Songs,Drag City,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"There was something reassuring about Jim O’Rourke turning up in 2015 and using the title  as a banner to tack across a set of deeply quixotic music. The album’s often difficult, sometimes purposefully stodgy, with O’Rourke carrying a newly gruff voice that bears a sailor’s bark, sometimes recalling unlikely figures like British bawler Joe Cocker. If it shares a singular trait with the other ""pop"" albums he’s made for Drag City, it’s in its complete removal from time and space—now, as then, this music exists in a vacuum, the result of a rare vision, moving from weathered to cozy, pushing and pulling horns and strings into places only O’Rourke can fathom. It can seem impenetrable at first, with tracks often deeply compressed under the weight of ideas. It’s in the passing of time that  finds its shape, causing it to slowly take on new, largely autumnal-shaded colors. Mostly, the power of allusion is foregrounded—you never get a great sense of who O’Rourke is from this music, with vague trails of humor and sadness and anger left behind, all left to make sense (or not) in the mind of the listener. —Nick Neyland"
44,Jazmine Sullivan,Reality Show,RCA,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Jazmine Sullivan’s return to music after a four-year silence is inspired by lives both imaginary and tragically personal. In 2011, she abruptly declared on social media that she was leaving the recording industry; the announcement represented a breaking point after quietly suffering in an abusive relationship. Sullivan was later rejuvenated by writing lyrics that empathized with all women, no matter their circumstances: the carefully preserved beauty who trades on her looks in ""Mascara"", the unemployed single mother turned bank robber in ""Silver Lining"", the ""Stupid Girl"" who is objectified and then cast aside like a used toy by men. Delivered with a spirited voice, and a sense of purpose, these songs could be a musical accompaniment to Alice Walker’s ""In Love & Trouble"". ""My flaws don’t look so bad,"" Sullivan sings on ""Masterpiece (Mona Lisa)"". ""Every part of me is beautiful, and I finally see I’m a work of art."" The 27-year-old Philly artist may have outgrown urban pop radio; her third album is the first in her career that hasn’t generated a major hit (although it found some success in urban adult contemporary). But  is a significant milestone for Sullivan, and for those of us who believe that modern-day R&B, despite its increasing blandness, can still inspire life-affirming art. —Mosi Reeves"

Refinement doesn't always require second-guessing, but when that does happen, you can get something as stirringly anxious as . Like Alex Chilton inverted, Bejar sings of dream lovers and trips to Bangkok, only in ways that reveal the disillusionment inside the rock'n'roll fantasy—the fatigue of an alt-pop hero who strives to sidestep the limelight. And in the process, Destroyer snatches irony from the grip of cheap comedy and resettles it in chilly melancholy.The bookend songs take the thought of falling in love with Times Square or a radio station, scrub it clean of the scuzzy romance of '70s NYC singer-songwriter myth, and reveal it to be a case of corporate Stockholm syndrome. Big cities are boundaries to escape (the John Carpenter-alluding ""The River"") or speculation-damaged husks of their former selves (""Oh, it sucks when there's nothing but gold in those hills,"" from ""Girl in a Sling""). And the haunting moments out of vanished-past arrangements— strings and soured Chicago horns—are the compellingly bitter flourishes to an album where nostalgia feels less like an escape than a reminder that the ways things go to shit simply shift with the tides. Even the Roxy/Springsteen charge-ahead wallop of ""Dream Lover"" feels like a deliberately hollow victory, the closest he gets to fun being ""someone's idea"" of it. But sometimes, intangible ennui is a great way to connect. —Nate Patrin

But despite song titles like ""Sad 2"" and lyrical assertions that she's ""the kind of girl buses splash with rain,"" the true triumph of  comes from a sense of wide-eyed innocence and optimism that runs through the record's brief 17-minute runtime. Similar to the several decades of indie pop antecedents that populate the rosters of Slumberland and K Records, guitars shimmer and sputter, drums clatter to life with a lighthearted crackle, and Kline's apparently downcast lyrics turn tongue-in-cheek, offering ways of overcoming in the midst of post-millennial malaise. It's a surprisingly mature sentiment from a songwriter who was only 19 years old at the time of the album's release, especially in an era where void-gazing is popular enough to become . As she sings on ""My I Love You"", sometimes you just have to ""do what [you] have to do,"" and Kline has uniquely figured out how to soundtrack that process in a sneakily buoyant way. —Colin Joyce

,Nils Frahm,Spaces,Erased Tapes,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention," only grew in stature over the course of the year following its late-2013 release. Its humble beginnings, lost in the November deadzone, might have caused it to be overlooked altogether. Instead, it became the type of album that was quietly passed around, gaining word-of-mouth traction for the captivating world Nils Frahm delicately spins around himself. The album perfectly taps into a prevailing interest in minimalism, whether through newer artists such as Bing & Ruth and Bitchin Bajas, or in the cavalcade of reissues such as Light in the Attic’s  and RVNG’s Ariel Kalma retrospective. Even two masters of the tradition, Philip Glass and Steve Reich, shared a stage for the first time in over 30 years in 2014—a year that also marked the 50th anniversary of Terry Riley’s pivotal . Still, no one sounds quite like Frahm, performing on this most un-live sounding live album, which is executed with a spiritual twinkle that belies its rather earthy circumstances. There are magical properties here, giving  a quality that makes it easy to forget the world outside during its absorbing duration. —Nick Neyland

,Future,Honest,Epic / A1 / Free Bandz,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"On one hand, this was Future's year:  was the Atlanta rapper/singer's first true marquee release, his moment to be feted as rap royalty. He made the talk-show and morning show rounds; he had his strongest-ever first-sales week. On the other hand: those first-week sales totaled over 53,000, barely squeaking past Iggy Azalea, whose ""Fancy"" had yet to blow up. He cheated on Ciara, thereby earning him the white-hot, possibly-lifelong enmity of the hip-hop Internet. Then he made a terrible song called ""Pussy Overrated"" with Wiz Khalifa.All this was complicated further by the fact that, with , he made a diverse, sweeping, and often profoundly affecting stardom bid that was mostly swallowed by the Twitter landfill. He was tender and unguarded on the title track, cooing birds-egg fragile melodies into the song’s margins; he was a superhero on the Amadou & Miriam-sampling warrior's anthem ""Look Ahead"". He was a power balladeer on ""I Be U"", one of his most ebullient love songs ever. He was the most forceful and convincing coke rapper on ""Move That Dope"". (Oh, and on ""Benz Friendz (Whatchutola)"", he was a member of -era OutKast.) The album has mostly disappeared from the conversation, an ignominious fate—and proof that becoming a heavyweight sometimes means you sink like a stone. —Jayson Greene"
,M. Geddes Gengras,Ishi,Stones Throw / Leaving,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"At first blush, M. Geddes Gengras' latest  of modular synthesizer music may not appear terribly complicated; it seems like you might be able to convincingly replicate the title track by taping down a handful of keys and slowly twisting the knobs—any knobs, really. And that's OK: the Los Angeles musician's system-oriented approach to composition often involves setting up parameters he reasonably expects to yield interesting results, and simply walking away. But listen more closely, and the album's three tracks (plus a 44-minute ""bonus"" cut) turn out to be deeply, even wildly expressive, brimming with pinwheeling polyrhythms and quicksilver timbral shifts and micro-movements that feel as natural as the wind. It might be the most satisfying example of a certain kind of sunburst organ burble since Emeralds' , and, compared to the freeform sprawl of his collaborative work in LA Vampires, Pocahaunted, and Sun Araw, it's deliciously focused, too. Ambient that's far too dynamic to scan as merely ambient, it's wallpaper music for a liquefied world. —Philip Sherburne

,The Hotelier,"Home, Like Noplace Is There",Tiny Engines,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"An unfortunate side effect of your early 20s is a foolish desire to try to make sense of everything. There’s all this non-degradable waste hanging around your life like your old house, your old school, your old ex-lover—what do you do with all of it? That’s the irony of  being corralled into the ""emo revival,"" because it’s an album about how we are not really built to deal with nostalgia or the traumas of the past. The Hotelier do about 36 minutes of amateur punk-rock surgery on several tumorous events that they can’t seem to escape, and it becomes macabre and celebratory in the same shout-chorus. On the priceless ""Your Deep Rest"", Christian Holden rips these words out of his throat: ""I called in sick from your funeral/ Tradition of closure nearly felt impossible."" It’s a fictional tale of regret and self-loathing that doubles as the motto for the album: We are not built to handle all this. Holden’s heart is not a load-bearing structure, and all the hospital trips, addictions, psychoses, and suffocating suburban-Massachusetts backdrops are wounds he shouldn’t open up, but does anyway. Most punk is rooted in tearing down the present to make a better future—rightfully, because the Hotelier find out that it’s impossible to try to tear down the past. —Jeremy Larson

44,A Sunny Day in Glasgow,Sea When Absent,Lefse,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Cult band returns after four years in hiding, signs to a new label, hires a hotshot producer, molds their unpredictable,  music into four-minute pop songs, and confirms their fans’ worst fears. This is pretty much what happened to A Sunny Day in Glasgow on their wondrous fourth album , but leave it to these guys to make the same old song completely unrecognizable. This wasn’t about a small group of protective devotees fretting about antiquated ideas of ""selling out."" Rather, as a band with no established frontperson and no established homebase making genreless music that’s nearly impossible to pull off live, A Sunny Day in Glasgow is a pretty terrible business proposition. So when they  late last year, the greater concern was that they couldn’t be a traditional buzz band with a traditional hit record even if they tried. We’re in luck if they can try harder than they did here; drawing as much from blaring rock and banging hip-hop as their other previous, ill-fitting tags of ""shoegaze"" or ""dream-pop,""  is clear-eyed and cloudbursting, seemingly incompatible sounds best described by seemingly contradictory feelings—""incapacitating calm,"" ""frightening infatuation,"" ""aggressive joy.""

43,Madlib / Freddie Gibbs,Piñata,Madlib Invazion,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Freddie Gibbs is a technician who folds his words into flows so neat the seams never show—and the success of talents like that often rest on the shoulders of a producer. Retro-leaning beats invite pithy ""real hip-hop"" barbs; hew too mainstream and you risk landing in limbo with the overqualified, underappreciated Gunplays of the industry. As a promising allegiance with Jeezy’s CTE World label blossomed and ultimately disintegrated, Gibbs charted a new course, teaming with mercurial SoCal producer/multi-instrumentalist Madlib for a slow drip of EPs over three years. Their collaborative full length, , sees the duo meeting styles halfway, Gibbs’ gruff, despairing storytelling taking flight on his producer’s woozy, stoned instrumentals. Few who’ve followed either artist could have reasonably predicted this union would form or float (Madlib barely makes rap anymore), but it did, and  is a monument to the enduring magic of raw beats and bars. —Craig Jenkins

Above and around, Pallett’s preternaturally smooth voice offers a narrative unity of memory, judgment, and regret, the sonorousness of its croon like a floodlight affording no sympathetic shadows in which to hide. Its omniscience feels increasingly cutting as the words and music slide from the nostalgically self-diagnostic (""a copy of / Your room a holy mess"") through the elegiacally metaphysical (""the terror of the infinite … that it will never come again is what makes our life so sweet"") to the erotically specific (""you hooked your pinkies on my jeans""—a snapshot from the best-written sex scene of 2014), like a series of windows glancing upon the irreconcilable ""gap between what a man wants and what a man will receive.""  makes for endlessly uncomfortable listening not through ugliness, but through the ceaseless, yearning, searching dissatisfaction of its prettiness, an iron cage as torturous as it is intricately wrought. —Tim Finney"
41,Leon Vynehall,Music for the Uninvited,3024,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"British producer Leon Vynehall is relatively young, but his genteel, elegant compositions are marked by a respect for the history and cultural context of his genre and an awareness of the world around him. The title of his first lengthy release, , is a nod to the queer people of color who shaped the genesis of house music, dancing and forming communities to escape the marginalization that pervaded the rest of their lives; his production is studded with well-aged samples, voices from generations gone by speaking from beyond the void. They complement and embody songs that move in unexpected ways, percolating and building before achieving a stately grace. Vynehall’s reverence for the past doesn’t get in the way of his personality, either: he’s shaped by  and , possessed of a quiet confidence.

""What are we taking care of?"" she sings on ""That Battle Is Over"", as she questions the messages the media feeds her about personal fulfillment via childbirth, via marriage, via consumption. Above all,  is a darkly composed treatise on having a body as a sort of peculiar plight, with Hval wrapping her lingering questions about sexuality and politics in minimalist, slow-jazz instrumentals. A sense of chest-clutching spirituality lingers throughout, with Hval’s voice moving between whispering confession and wailing over organs like she’s experiencing Saint Teresa’s  herself. On  the body is a thing to subvert: to find ecstasy in metal binds, to soften canonical cock rock, to embrace self-doubt. To take care of oneself, Hval suggests, is to keep questioning how exactly one is supposed to physically exist in this world. —Hazel Cills

,iLoveMakonnen,iLoveMakonnen EP,self-released,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"Rap has always been a safe haven for weirdos, but 2014 was particularly kind to artists who vibrate on a slightly different frequency than the rest of us. iLoveMakonnen was one such beneficiary, going from YouTube curio to having Drake remix and sign him to his label seemingly overnight. He's been making music for years, but it's only recently that he caught the ear of veteran Atlanta producers like Sonny Digital and Metro Boomin. Makonnen gets their wooziest beats, the kind of tracks that are simultaneously weightless and dense as collapsing stars. There's ""Too Much"", where Makonnen's theatrical melodrama positions him as the trap game Andrew Lloyd Webber, the rap signifiers providing a frame of reference and helping communicate a loneliness that permeates the entirety of the  EP. ""Tonight"", which shimmers like the northern lights on an alien world, is just a few BPM short of being included on every deep-house DJ set for the next six months. And, of course, there's ""Club Goin Up on a Tuesday"", which features a hook barely tethered to this terrestrial plane. It might very well be the least testosterone-fueled celebration of Dionysian pleasures I've ever heard. This is Makonnen's secret—he's a sad boy and not just a #sadboy, and his music is an open hand extended to each and every one of us. —Renato Pagnani

,Ibeyi,Ibeyi,XL,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz’s debut album as Ibeyi opens with a sacred call to Eleggua, the deity of communication in Yoruban religion, a practice usually meant to signify the opening of a spiritual channel. As such, it’s a worthy placement: over the following 12 songs,  conjures soulful, invigorating, and wholly spiritual music, inspired by swooning R&B-electronic practitioners like James Blake as much as by the French-Cuban twins’ deeply musical Yoruban heritage. The album is dedicated in part to their late father, Anga Díaz, a percussionist in Buena Vista Social Club, whose presence figures most prominently in Naomi’s stark use of the cajón and Batá drums that carry the album along at an arresting, breathless rhythm. But his ghost, and others, are all over : in the clipped vocal sample that opens the trip-hop-indebted ""Think of You"", in the narratives that drive somber ballads ""Mama Says"" and ""Behind the Curtain"", and in the many instances in which the twins break out into Yoruban chants, as on gorgeous, river goddess-dedicated,  ""River"". What makes  truly exceptional, though, is the sisters’ obvious synergy, each breath and drum between the two suggestive of something both sacred and intangible. —Eric Torres"
,Lower Dens,Escape From Evil,Ribbon Music,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"You could chalk up the impressive strides that Lower Dens made on  to just smart business sense. Having watched Baltimore buds Beach House and Future Islands dramatically increase their festival-billing font size in recent years, Lower Dens hit the bullseye between the former’s wistful melodicism and the latter’s synth-pumped propulsion. But as you listen to singer Jana Hunter ache, quiver, grimace, and seethe her way through the record’s 10 songs, another motive becomes apparent. Lower Dens transformed from shadowy drone-rock experimentalists to a diamond-chiseled electro-pop crew because that’s precisely what these unflinching, at times brutally honest songs demanded: clear lines of communication, the static and noise scraped away to maximize their emotional impact.Consistent with the album’s glassy, austere sound, Hunter sings like someone with the stoic resolve to get herself through the most discomfiting of conversations, but with an underlying unease that suggests she could break down at any moment. But for Hunter, even the most difficult exchanges are something to cherish.  demands face-to-face interaction, whether it’s delivering bald expressions of desire (""Quo Vadis""), the last goodbyes in a broken relationship (""Ondine""), or remorse over inflicting psychological damage that can’t be undone (""I Am the Earth""). It’s easy to interpret that album title as a comment on the extremist forces currently hellbent on destroying America from without and within, but the real battleground surveyed on  is the one connecting our heads and our hearts, the space where our insecurities take root and stifle the sort of open, meaningful dialogue this album so bravely encourages. —Stuart Berman

,Levon Vincent,Levon Vincent,Novel Sound,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Levon Vincent has always had a fierce independent streak, releasing his music largely through his own label, mentoring young producers, giving away digital versions of his vinyl-only tracks. The release of , his debut album, seemed to take his proclivity for DIY to almost troll-ish levels. The album arrived (digitally) via a WeTransfer link in a tweet. If you were fortunate enough to get your hands on a copy of the (reasonably priced) 4xLP set, it arrived in a bubble-wrap pouch, four slabs of vinyl in unmarked sleeves, each labeled with a unique sticker hand-cut from a magazine. A re-printed handwritten note served as the ; ""Special Thanks to Everyone,"" it reads.All of this is notable only because the music matches the medium.  comprises 11 craggy, pockmarked tracks full of synths that refuse to march in exact lockstep with the drums. It offers up melodies that carry on a few bars longer than expected. Vincent plays with the conventions of techno the same way you might play fast and loose with a recipe’s ratios: a dash of extra krautrock here, a pinch of dub there. It's a cliche when talking about techno—machine music—that you can really hear the person behind it. On  it's more difficult to locate the machines behind the person. —Andrew Gaerig"
,Jessica Pratt,On Your Own Love Again,Drag City,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Draped over gorgeous fingerpicked guitar melodies, Jessica Pratt’s voice is a singular, otherworldly instrument. Yet the Californian sounds grounded and self-assured throughout her second album, . In almost every song, she reaches out to someone who’s standing directly in front of her, but the distance is both palpable and insurmountable. Tears and pleas have given way to the sober realization that she’s arrived at a new phase in her life (""I see that you’re leaving, so what can I say""). It’s tempting to read some of Pratt’s real-life narrative in these songs. She’d lost her mother and ended a very long relationship. The album was home-recorded in a state of isolation—L.A. was right outside her window, but Pratt stayed inside, repeatedly playing these songs until they were exactly right (and her fingers began to hurt). She harmonizes with herself and occasionally tucks into full-on psychedelia, letting her voice and guitar melt into an entirely different register. Every song packs the unmistakable whiff of lingering pain, but there’s also acceptance—the sound of someone charting a new course in the face of loss. —Evan Minsker

,Protomartyr,The Agent Intellect,Hardly Art,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Across Protomartyr’s three albums, the Detroit band’s essentials have gone largely unchanged. Joe Casey’s poetry, for one, has always been engaging—a teetering pile of references and odd conversational phrases where rage, melancholy, and absurdity melt together. The band is often described as post-punk, which is probably due to Casey’s deep voiced bellow and overall intensity. It really depends on the song, though, since Greg Ahee’s guitar can either provide breakneck razorwire punk or glossy anthemic sheen. On their latest album , they’ve undergone their biggest change to date: They’ve become a better band. Casey’s ragged, slurred vocals from the debut album are long gone. Here, he turns in the best performance of his life, offering greater impetus to focus on his words. Alex Leonard’s drumming seems to have improved. It’s also their most kinetic album, offering very few pauses across its 44 minutes.With a few subtle tweaks and improvements, Protomartyr accentuate their strengths. Even better, there’s something intrinsically risky about the album’s most delicate moments. This band could have easily coasted on the garage rock immediacy of their debut album . Instead, they deliver the lengthy, patient ""Ellen""—a love song about Casey’s mother. Instead of leaning on his more verbose inclinations, Casey repeats just a few lines over his band’s most beautiful music to date. It’s one of several moments where you get to peer into Casey’s experiences—""Why Does It Shake"" is something his mother asked about the tremors in her hand, and ""I Forgive You"" references a chemistry teacher from Casey’s old high school who was recently locked up on child pornography and molestation charges.Those moments are what make Protomartyr such a captivating band—the promise that even though we might not always understand what every line means, there’s an implication that everything here comes from a place that’s real and personal. People don’t just pay attention to Joe Casey because of his voice or stage presence—people want to get to know him through this music. That’s partially why their annual hometown Jumbo’s gig on December 26 has become flooded with ""false friends"" and ""weird faces""—""I don’t like it,"" he sings of the phenomenon on ""Pontiac 87"". If he keeps making music this good, he’s probably going to have to get used to the unwanted attention. —Evan Minsker

,Prurient,Frozen Niagara Falls,Profound Lore,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Perpetual collapse and implosion: It’s a tough dynamic to sustain across a single song, let alone an entire career of them. Yet Dominick Fernow, who creates multi-faceted noise music as Prurient, has been at this game for many years, culminating in the double album —a suite of 16 tracks that’s fearless in its utter capitulation to fear. On ""Myth of Building Bridges"", a modulated symphony of static dissolves into a muffled, digitized rebirthing ritual; on ""Every Relationship Earthrise"", he uses icy, fragmented synth-pop as the foundation for a sustained spasm of screaming that ultimately devours itself. The deep catharsis, though, comes more potently on the album’s semi-acoustic songs such as ""Greenpoint"" and ""Christ Among the Broken Glass"", which treat folk guitar like some ancient artifact and whispers like bloodcurdling, lung-melting confessions. If fear has become the blank canvas of our collective existence,  poignantly, harrowingly scrawls a map across it. —Jason Heller

As the title promises, these 10 songs are technically about love, but Sundfør’s conception of romance owes more to the brutality of the  movies than the Hollywood idealism of . ""Silencer"" opens with her standing over her lover's still-warm body clenching a gun. On ""Delirious"", she at least gives her paramour a head’s up when she vows to push him over the edge—it’s a threat, yes, but by this album's cutthroat standards, it’s also an expression of love.Sundfør backs up her bluster with some of the most unabashedly audacious pop compositions of the year. A sinister church organ rips through the gothy ""Accelerate"" with hellfire fury, while the raved-up EDM synths of ""Kamikaze"" hit like shocks from a downed power line. And for her grandest display, she’s assisted by M83’s Anthony Gonzalez on the 10-minute ""Memorial"", which plays like a mid-album classical recital break yet somehow fits right in on this bold, violent odyssey of a record. —Evan Rytlewski"

Much of the record is built around interlocking patterns, with Stetson using circular breathing to keep up with Neufeld’s violin. Together, they create surging soundscapes that have some of the same rushing qualities as Philip Glass or Moondog, but with an entirely less precise and more melancholy outcome than either of those forebears. The highly rhythmic approach of the album’s showcase tracks is balanced by more delicately melodic pieces—""Won’t Be a Thing to Become"" is gorgeous and dusty, relying on simple themes to perfect its chilly atmosphere, while the title track is like a huge, eight-minute sigh of exhaustion.Though they’re perhaps best known for their mutual association with Arcade Fire, Neufeld and Stetson actually met before his involvement with that group, and this is their second collaboration, after 2013’s original score for , a movie based on the story of the Beltway snipers. Their work together is assuming an identity as distinct as any of the myriad other projects either has been involved in. —Joe Tangari

The music on the band’s  can be as stark as its black-and-white cover, and as frozen as their Calgary home. Yet these seven songs pump with boiled blood and stung nerves, as red as your hands when you’re worried they might be frostbitten. This bi-thermal, dark-and-light aura draws its energy from '80s and '90s post-punk, and it’s what makes this quartet exciting outside of the surface of their songs. They inject a fervent catchiness into their dour post-punk that makes tunes like  sound as much like Blondie as Joy Division. So even though Viet Cong concludes with a bludgeoning 11-minute track called ""Death"", the song itself ends with a joyous burst of sprinting guitars. Viet Cong may sound like they live in a tunnel, but they always have their eyes on the light at the end of it. —Marc Masters

,Young Thug,Slime Season 1 & 2,self-released,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2015: Honorable Mention,"Young Thug’s forebears, Lil Wayne and Gucci Mane, were moved to the same type of stylistic experimentation and excess as their successor. But Tunechi and Gucci spread out their quality offerings; neither came close to releasing something like the concentrated, cohesive double-dose of quality music represented by the combined 40-tracks of the  . The tapes, put out in quick succession this fall, are a world unto themselves, a Halloween horrorshow built from rotting organic matter as Thug piles reference upon reference to flora and fauna, fungus, bees, cabbage. Listening feels like living in Poison Ivy’s greenhouse. Even the diamonds resemble pimples. The consistently high quality of what seems like a collection of odds and ends is notable. But more compelling is just how deep these 40 tracks take us into Thug’s self-made Hades. Throughout his career, Jeffrey Williams has most often been concerned with the joys of sex, violence and twisted verbalization. But on , a new element emerged to accompany his famously bizarre style. It was apparent in poignant details, like this extra-musical tidbit: Thug is introducing us to a track’s producer, and mistakenly calls him an engineer. And then, bashfully, he apologizes: ""I’m high, sorry."" It’s a moment of tenderness that doesn’t explicitly evoke sex, a glimpse of Thug’s vulnerable underbelly. When someone speaks and/or raps in a nigh-incomprehensible slang, it’s reasonable to assume that he is trying to keep others out. But when that same dude releases 40 tracks spotted through with moments like these, it might just be a sign that he’s attempting to let us in. —Jonah Bromwich

39,Holly Herndon,Platform,4AD / Rvng Intl.,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Holly Herndon’s  was named for the work of design strategist , and it’s a title that packs a lot in: the geometric language and corporate obfuscation of media-tech talk, a space for boosting fellow artists’ work (which, it’s worth noting, Herndon does; on  she curates the work of dozens of others), the sense of something elevated. Indeed, each track on  bursts with more ideas and theories and gorgeous musique concrète scrambling than many artists manage on entire albums, and proves Herndon’s whirlwind imagination as a composer. The through-line, though, is an argument for the undervalued artistic utility of the voice.Herndon goes beyond the standard voice-as-instrument tropes, the pitch-shifting and snippetizing that are pro forma for art-pop these days—though she certainly excels at these, such as on ""Chorus"", which comes off as a cappella performed to the beat of a crumbling tectonic plate. Herndon’s interest, rather, lies in the human element, and how it can be exploited. Sometimes it’s playful: the voiceover-perfect advertising timbre of ""Locker Leak"", which pulps Philip Glass, Greek yogurt, social media jargon, and contextless taglines to dizzying effect. Elsewhere it’s disarming; the surveillance agent of ""Home"" evokes EMA’s ""Neuromancer"" (""I know that you know me better than I know me"") but has less to say about Technology These Days than about loneliness, and desire, and how closeness never quite guarantees connection.Perhaps the most misunderstood track on  is ""Lonely at the Top"", which ruthlessly exploits the disembodied close-mic’d intimacy and swaddling femininity of ASMR. It’s as close to a shortcut to immersion as audio’s got, and Herndon and vocalist Claire Tolan use it to deposit the listener, quite literally forcibly, into the megalomaniacal and quite possibly sexual fantasy of an executive weaned on Tolan’s just-world-hypothesis coo: ""All of your achievements just seem like your natural right."" The effect is rather like slipping into a warm bath, then realizing it is poison and under your skin. —Katherine St. Asaph

38,Arca,Mutant,Mute,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Arca’s 2014 masterpiece  was a dense, gnomic self-portrait of producer Alejandro Ghersi as a cryptically erotic extraterrestrial, and many of the obsessive fans that came up in its wake were still untangling its plentiful knots when he dropped  just over a year later. Of the two records,  is less fraught, and more direct. Ghersi’s insistence on avoiding straightforward, repetitive beats makes it hardly more danceable than its predecessor, but the album frequently offers meaningful nods to less thoroughly deconstructed forms of electronic music on tracks like ""Alive"" and ""Snakes"" that seem to have sizeable chunks of jungle and breakbeat hardcore in its heavily altered genetic code. Arca’s work is best appreciated when you take your attention away from the intricately wrought details and let it just wash over you. The sensation this time around is warmer and tinged with uncomplicated hedonism, the sound of Arca’s alien alter ego getting past its issues and going out clubbing. —Miles Raymer

37,Empress Of,Me,Terrible,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"“Should I be afraid?” Lorely Rodriguez asks in the opening seconds of , her debut LP under the Empress Of moniker. She sounds hesitant, but Rodriguez has little reason to be—over 's 10 tracks, she makes a strong case for herself as one of the most confident, skilled pop artists of the year. The delicate, '80s-nodding  EP from 2013 laid the groundwork for Rodriguez's technical prowess, but  presents the Empress Of project at its boldest: Rodriguez's voice is front and center, and the melodies that anchor it are contained in airtight, dancefloor-ready synths. It's unsurprising that Rodriguez wrote and recorded the entire album herself during an isolated five-week stay in Mexico, pressure-cooking all of her ideas into existence.Rodriguez is adept at negotiating her status in the world through song, whether it be scrutinizing privilege or vilifying cat-callers. She just as easily taps into the emotions around spiky relationships, too: ""Got to get high to get by without you,"" goes the chorus of ""To Get By"", a depressing sentiment tempered by the song's giddy electro pulse. As its title suggests,  is a reflective debut, but it's far from self-obsessed; in the middle of fitful pop gem ""Need Myself"", she lasers in: ""I think I'm the one I need.""

36,Janet Jackson,Unbreakable,BMG / Rhythm Nation,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Janet Jackson's  marks a return to form but, like her best records, it's also a gentle expansion of that form. Jackson, and her longtime collaborators, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, bend their flexible R&B so that it absorbs a wide range of aesthetics, from DJ Mustard’s space-age electro, to Joni Mitchell’s acoustic contemplation, to a kind of blurred country soul. It is a record about intimacy and relationships—personal, political, metaphysical. Even Jackson’s single concession to EDM, ""Shoulda Known Better"", flows and recedes with the drift of a magnetic field as she sings reflexively against the shimmer. Throughout the album, the bass tones are either subtracted or located exclusively in the drums, giving these songs the unstable gravity of a feather. It’s a shaky weightlessness that mirrors the vulnerability and wisdom of Jackson’s own voice. —Brad Nelson

It’s an easy request to make, considering that Palomo has pushed his solo act to its most enjoyable, accessible peak. Over an hour of catchy electro-dance tracks, Palomo draws on all the style, energy, and excess of the '80s for a set of glitchy, sample-happy romps. Many songs here openly call back to his past solo work as VEGA, coming across as an extended DJ set best suited for gleaming discotheques where clubgoers are dressed in garish get-ups, everyone’s eyes are a little glazed over, and last call never, ever comes. Palomo stretches his production dexterity into other genres with , too, threading songs like ""Annie"" with dubby reggae and “The Glitzy Hive"" with bright-eyed disco. There's an extended techno breakdown (""Techno Clique""), an ode to an '80s porn mag (""Dear Skorpio Magazine""), and a sultry murder mystery (""Baby's Eyes""). It's a lot to take in, but  is one of the most rewarding trips into lurid '80s nostalgia in a year filled with them. —Eric Torres

34,Carly Rae Jepsen,E•MO•TION,Interscope / School Boy,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015," No one knows this better than Carly Rae Jepsen, who stumbled into one of the decade's most ubiquitous songs and then had to stumble out from under it. (""I, personally, am sick of hearing myself on the radio,"" she recalls saying around the time the dust had settled.) Jepsen spent two years convincing her label to let her write her own songs, finding the right collaborators, and even appearing in a Broadway musical for a change of pace. She came out the other side with , an album that highlighted her gifts, captured the hearts of a newly dedicated fanbase, and went criminally overlooked commercially.The album's chart performance is a shame, because  deserves more than a cult following. Jepsen is a songwriter capable of wringing exceptional things from standard pop forms, and she sells it so well that you might not even notice its genius until you really listen. She has a way with odd turns of phrase (""Who gave you eyes like that/ Said you could keep them?"" or ""Warm blood feels good""), she can frame simple ideas in beautiful ways (""When I'm close to you/ We blend into my favorite color""), and she can bend clichés to her will and make them feel vital and new again (""Run Away With Me""). And that doesn't even cover half the songs on the record.Every song on  takes a different feeling and makes it seem like the most important thing in the world. The album is always on the cusp of something—of falling in love, of heartbreak, or even, in the most Carly Rae Jepsen of all feelings, of just finally realizing that you might kinda like someone. An artistic triumph if not a commercial one, this record proves Jepsen's point: pop music is a challenge. But on , at least for an hour, it sounds totally effortless. —Andrew Ryce"
33,Archy Marshall,A New Place 2 Drown,XL / True Panther,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Archy Marshall’s  feels like a record found underneath a chair in a pub’s dark corner, down there with blackened coins and decades-old cigarette butts. The music gurgles like something coughed up from a manhole, a supremely atmospheric mix of beat styles ranging from '90s rap to early '00s grime. The Londoner Marshall, best known for his King Krule project, vocalizes in a space that triangulates between singing, rapping, and heavily intoxicated slurring. When he delivers lines like ""Even though you fucked him I don’t really give a shit"" and ""When it rains it fucking pours/ Sky opens its mouth and spits to the floor,"" he hints at a grim and broken world, one where you expect the worst and usually get it. —Mark Richardson"
32,Dr. Dre,Compton,Interscope / Aftermath,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"After a gestation so lengthy it threatened to replace the Beach Boys’  as most tragic victim of its auteur’s unassailable perfectionism, it turns out Dr. Dre’s fabled third album  had to die in order for the good doctor to serve his hungry base with fresh prescription. Using the occasion of the N.W.A biopic  as both muse and news peg, Dre set about the seemingly insurmountable task of bridging three generations of California gangster rap on a record both of-the-moment and observant of the history that made all of it possible. From the ashes of  rose , a self-mythologizing swan song that unfurls the story of the man and his city in pristine, cinematic sound.Like , which painted Dre as mentor and studio maven extraordinaire,  deftly recasts its creator’s lengthy waits between albums as a mogul’s never-ending quest for capital. That it succeeds, while uniting Cali rap talent from the '80s (Ice Cube), '90s (Snoop, Above the Law’s Cold 187um), '00s (The Game), and today (Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak), speaks to the enduring legacy of Dre as one of hip-hop’s great business and creative minds. That  slaps from end to end while sounding like little else than itself? That’s why you wait on genius. —Craig Jenkins"
31,Kelela,Hallucinogen EP,Warp / Cherry Coffee,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"When L.A. artist Kelela announced her  EP, she  of its themes: ""It speaks to the narcotic that is loving someone. It makes you exhilarated, it makes you feel drained, it’s in your body and it affects you so completely."" But if love is the drug here, Kelela's not an addict jonesing for a fix, she's a soothsayer on a vision quest. The record's six tracks—ranging from glossy R&B to freestyling dance-pop to minimal trip-hop—each find her cool, smoky voice illustrating one illusory exchange after another. She doesn't impart the visions themselves, but rather interprets how they manifest before her. We see desire as imagined glances across a room, sex as a rush of chemicals and phantom gestures, heartbreak as a silhouette lost to a crowded dancefloor, regret as calls and letters left unanswered.Kelela's way with rich imagery made  deep as the burgundies and purples in its artwork, but her natural charisma is why it felt so magnetic in the first place. Hers isn't just a voice you want to hear, it's one you want to hear . Flanked by the likes of Arca, Kingdom, and DJ Dahi on production, Kelela gives every outré beat a center of gravity, every reimagined trope a touch of singularity. She's come a long way since  in 2013. This year solidified the hunch that Kelela wouldn't—no, —stay secondary to her big name collaborators. —Patric Fallon

,Makthaverskan,II,Run for Cover,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"Makthaverskan's chest-clearing dream-punk seems to plunk itself right at the intersection between enthusiasm and frustration, where you just come right out and say what you're thinking, however awkwardly it may emerge.  is a beauteous little beast of a record, caught between primal scream and Vaseline-smeared swoon; every emotion's played to the hilt, every instrument surging towards one grand feeling or another. With the vocab of a longshoreman and a windmill-felling voice, singer Maja Milner serves up equal parts invective and longing in the most unambiguous language possible; ""fuck you for fucking me when I was 17,"" she wails on ""No Mercy"", while, just one song later, she's hoping a ""pretty baby"" will stay close this time. Forget your subtler emotional shades for a second; the hard-charging Makthaverskan deal solely in black, white, and blood red. And that willingness to go for broke—to say what needs to be said without couching it in metaphor or drowning it in distortion—is what makes  such a thrilling listen. You might flub the name, but you'll remember the feeling. —Paul Thompson

,Migos,Rich Nigga Timeline,Quality Control,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"This year, Migos proved to be in it for the long haul. Back in 2013, the  and Drake co-sign came so quickly to the Atlanta trio that those unfamiliar with their pre-""Versace"" work could understandably wonder if the world would remember the names Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff a year later. But they made sure no one forgot: , their second mixtape of 2014, showed impressive growth, if not topically, then at least technically. Their flows felt more locked-in than ever before, but still malleable enough that any line here could easily become a hook for another song. One holdover from last year’s  is their goofy bluntness (""she stomped the booty on me like some Timbs""), which is no longer hidden within their now-familiar triplet flow. But no matter what memes they might inspire, these are trap rappers who’ve gotten in fights with concert crowds, had chains snatched, and seen their tour van lined with bullet holes. Those real-world events aren’t their main concern on ; rather, Migos remain aspirational even in the face of adversity, continuing to view the world through their Versace shades. —David Turner

,Objekt,Flatland,Pan,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"TJ Hertz conjures a severe bustle on his debut album, . The young Berlin-based producer spends 45 minutes contorting his tracks into odd positions, a sadomasochistic yoga with poses like ""broken glass"" and ""chrome."" It's techno music—jarring, acrid, tough—but it's techno music that sets aside the normal points of comparison such as factories and engines. Instead it conjures a freshly-minted skyscraper, a monolith of engineering that forces us to consider the specialized knowledge required to erect such a structure as well as the air and skyline it displaces.At its most striking,  makes its noise peers sound quaint, like theirs is a steampunk version of what's to come, with all its rivets and corroding metals and 4/4 kick drum patterns having been conceived 200 years ago. The future is instead seamless, frictionless, precise. Devoid of a constant pulse, of familiar tropes (though is that acid I hear on ""Ratchet""?),  is a challenging listen. In a year when so many artists seemed skeptical about the role of technology in our lives,  is an album that asks not what machines are doing to us, but what we can do with machines. —Andrew Gaerig

,Pallbearer,Foundations of Burden,Profound Lore,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"Two years ago Pallbearer released , 2012’s best metal debut, and then decided it wasn’t good enough. Thus came this year’s , a record that improves on every facet of . Brett Campbell’s not only improved as a singer, but also doesn’t bury his voice like he did last time. And the songwriting itself has grown tremendously, in no small part due to bassist Joseph D. Rowland’s insistence on exploring prog’s slicker edge. And  boasts lusher production, a denser sonic palette that serves both as a meeting point of the strengths of  (and their buzzed-about 2010 demo), and as a sign that they’ve surpassed their previous work. Combined with lyrics focusing on the darker side of solitude, they’ve slowed down but built upon the cosmic poignancy of Judas Priest’s classic '70s suicide ballad ""Beyond the Realms of Death"".One of the album’s finest moments is its first: the opening lead of ""Worlds Apart"" screams glory. It’s the Golden Riff basement guitarist stumble through bud and beer to try and write, and it’s the sort of sound Boston’s Tom Scholz would spend months obsessing over, trying to get just right. (With Pallbearer’s professed love of Boston, maybe he’ll get a chance on the next record.) Then again, they’re fine with leaving sliding noises on ""The Ghost I Used to Be"", a sign that even with all their ambition and skill, they’re still four dudes from Little Rock who are just glad their music’s out there. All the better that it’s being appreciated by an increasingly broad swath of listeners. —Andy O'Connor

,Protomartyr,Under Color of Official Right,Hardly Art,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"You've met a greasy loner like Protomartyr lead singer Joe Casey before; he's the guy who makes jaundice seem cool.  was easily the mustiest musical object I couldn't keep myself from handling all year, like a mildewing, smutty paperback I picked up in the attic. The guitars, which are so thick they seem to blot out the band's existence entirely, sit like black mold on top of Casey's crude pronouncements, which land somewhere between bark and a belch. Nonetheless, there is a lot of sense in the singer’s ugliness. ""What I swallow and what I eat/ I pay it no mind,"" he drawls, sardonically, on ""Want Remover"", and this kind of defeated indifference pervades this band’s music like air conditioning. ""Overconfidence is a parasite,"" he spits, repeatedly, on ""Bad Advice"", but it's difficult to imagine anyone in Protomartyr's world suffering from it. —Jayson Greene

,Isaiah Rashad,Cilvia Demo,Top Dawg Entertainment,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"This year, the California-based rap collective TDE expanded all the way to Tennessee with the release of Isaiah Rashad’s . The Chattanooga native’s usually understated voice is an easy cloak for the vitality of his music, where recurring references to police violence and racial tension build upon each other. Though Rashad’s still in his early 20s, he projects an assured confidence in asking about the world, religion, or himself. And his willingness to wade into these difficult questions follows the linage of OutKast (""West Savannah"") and Scarface (""Brad Jordan""), fellow Southern souls who displayed far more worldly experience than their age would suggest. —David Turner

,Ricky Eat Acid,Three Love Songs,Orchid Tapes,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"So much of ambient music wants to break out of your headphones and roll around a mountain range or a cathedral.  immediately sets itself in a bedroom. Sam Ray prefaces his electronic debut with a tape-hissy spoken word piece that describes lying in bed and hearing someone else walk around downstairs, running their hands along a piano, until eventually a light subsumes the house and that person is all that's left. is a long, slow fever that moves from a bedroom to a car to a front yard. All its settings are small. They're also remarkably intimate; listen close to ""In rural virginia"" and you'll get to hear a seatbelt slither through its clasp as a radio preacher warns you about God's looming wrath. Other voices surface and recede; even Drake's in a driving loop on the house approximation ""In my dreams we're almost touching"". They're all specters haunting a room so familiar it can be worn like skin.If the body's a house, then love is a ghost that haunts it. Ray's beautiful, understated LP burrows deep to get at the love that swirls in us even when we're lying very still. —Sasha Geffen

,Shamir,Northtown EP,Godmode,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"Nineteen-year-old Shamir Bailey seemed to come from nowhere, even as  had folks rushing to place him in the heritage of Midwest dance. He’s in fact from Las Vegas—a city known more as a culturally stagnant musical retirement village than the epicentre of vitality—and his signing to New York's GODMODE belied the edge that was immediately obvious to anyone staggered by his debut single ""If It Wasn't True"". Across five tracks, Shamir tilts against cynicism, dredging catharsis out of disappointment. Sometimes, it’s in his crackling vocals, like on the frightened ""I'll Never Be Able to Love""; elsewhere, it’s through the stomping ""I Know It's a Good Thing"" or the let-down pessimism of ""Sometimes a Man"". Before he'd go on to defiant, snappy self-possession with the late-2014 post-EP single ""On the Regular"",  presented Shamir as a delicate kid trying to hold it together. This disco-pop upstart might've been a surprise, but from minute one Shamir sounded like he was at home. —Jake Cleland

,Sleaford Mods,Divide and Exit,Harbinger Sound,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"Upon uploading  to iTunes, the default genre that displays is ""Blues""—which is as an apt a descriptor as any for Sleaford Mods’ block-rocking bleats. Too steely and mechanistic to be categorized purely as punk, too manic and wired to be hip-hop, and too aggressively artless to qualify as poetry,  is the sound of chronic, cantankerous disappointment, as produced by two forty-something wage slaves who are dispirited by pop culture’s constant repackaging of the past, but who also dread our future—so they opt to put the ""resent"" in the present. More than just simply declare that modern life is rubbish, motormouth-piece Jason Williamson dumpster-dives through the rubbish of modern life, his venomous verbiage indiscriminately taking down targets like a military firing squad: Twitter, processed cheese, Oasis, coked-out Shoreditch hipsters, currywurst, art displayed in tea shops, Chumbawamba, ""swivel servants,"" Heaven 17, “GG fuckin’ Allin,” middle-class “trainspottists,” Joe Cocker, Nicolas Cage, Thomas the Tank Engine, and that twat Ian who still works in a clothing shop. (Tellingly, the words to ’s songs have yet to turn up en masse on Internet lyric sites, presumably because they’d require a veteran courthouse stenographer to transcribe them.) And even when Williamson’s targets are off, he still hits the bull’s eye: on ""Tied Up in Notzz"", he derisively proclaims, ""It’s 'The Final Countdown' by fookin’ Journey,"" but it’s a case of mistaken identity that serves as a pointed comment on the interchangeable, faceless nature of the '80s corporate rock that still dominates pub playlists. And even if it’s an actual honest mistake, pity the fool who tries to correct him. —Stuart Berman

,Ka,The Night's Gambit,Iron Works,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"New York rap stalwart Ka is DIY down to the socks. He produces himself. He directs and edits his own videos. Fans were alerted to the existence of his third album via a tweet promising an appearance outside NYC’s shuttered Fat Beats Records with copies in tow. His online store asks patience of fans because he doesn’t get to the post office every day. It’s a rugged individualism that permeates his music as well; ’s songs are bare-bones monuments to self-sufficiency, vegetarianism, 5 Percenter wisdom, and perseverance. The beats do the most with the absolute least too. Opener “You Know It’s About” compresses the stinking doom of Black Sabbath’s self-titled debut album opener into fearful quietude. “Barring the Likeness” is a two-chord bout of RZA-and-kung-fu tribute. Ka’s voice scarcely breaks a librarian’s whisper; death’s ever around the corner, and you don’t want him to hear you stressing. —Craig JenkinsKa: "
,Kelela,Cut 4 Me,Fade to Mind,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"After a life-changing move to Los Angeles, singer-songwriter Kelela Mizanekristos fell in with the vanguard contingent stalking R&B and electronic music's outer limits, collaborating with producer Kingdom’s Fade to Mind collective, the UK bass music label Night Slugs, and eventually linking with Solange Knowles’ newly assembled Saint Heron Records squadron. Kelela’s debut mixtape gently pushes the envelope, her soft spot for 90s R&B divas like Brandy converging with Kingdom and co.’s stark soundscapes to create something vaguely familiar but new—a hypnagogic Aaliyah for the PS1 set. ’s rogues’ gallery of liars, cheats, and dirtbags get flambéed throughout this batch of straight-shooting love-as-warfare missives. For every wrongdoing, Kelela snaps back with a savage cut like “Floor Show”’s “You forget my name, but you say it every night” and “Send Me Out”’s pithy, bored opener: “Love, do I have to spell it out? ...You do your thing, I’m going out.” The production lopes forward like broken things, but Kelela’s breathy vocal runs imbue with a unifying warmth and character. —Craig Jenkins

,Logos,Cold Mission,Keysound,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Logos belongs to a cadre of geographically disparate producers who have quietly refigured grime into something more curious and modern.  acts as a counterpoint to widespread nostalgia for London's other-other pirate radio movement, hardcore, which had on-the-nose odes offered up all year by Special Request, among others. Unlike hardcore, grime never really ran its course: Just as the genre seemed poised to take off, the MCs absconded to the charts while the producers scattered to dubstep or house, or quit altogether. Grime's resurrection as an instrumental form avoided nostalgia largely because there was still so much territory to explore.On , Logos teases out the tension between grime's bloodied-nose rhythms and its pliable, batty melodies. It's patient and austere for a work that, on multiple occasions, uses a cocking gun as percussion. Logos' melodies are cold and glassy, its rhythms huge and blunt. Listening to  is like staring at the moon while sitting across from an active construction site. There's lots of banging, but the mood is calm. —Andrew GaerigLogos: (excerpts)"
,Jessie Ware,Tough Love,Universal Island / PMR,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year 2014: Honorable Mention,"After her wisely low-key debut  snuck up on plenty of people in 2012, Jessie Ware took a more immediate path on the charming, poppier . The UK singer recruited a roster of big name collaborators (Miguel, Ed Sheeran, Emile Haynie, Dev Hynes) to help her craft a sophomore effort filled with jaunty pop anthems (""Cruel""), slinky R&B confessionals (""Kind of…Sometimes…Maybe""), and requisite torch songs (""Say You Love Me""). Ware’s voice is nothing less than indomitable, and on  she stretches it even further, from the high-pitched falsetto on the album’s swooning title track to the hymnal ranges it climbs during closer ""Desire"".  may be a bit safer than her last record, but Ware's ability to craft a gut punch out of sensual and elegant love songs is still absolutely intact. —Eric Torres

,Lorde,Pure Heroine,Lava / Republic,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Savvy pop-cycle watchers could have guessed that the airhorn era was due for a dive; in fact,  of 2013's #1 hits were fueled by the deathless chest-beating thump that has largely defined Top 40 radio for the last few years thanks to the likes of will.i.am, LMFAO, Calvin Harris, and David Guetta. But  knew that the most obvious signpost for this sea change would be a teenager from New Zealand who counts James Blake, TNGHT, the Replacements, and Raymond Carver as formative influences and, depending on whom you ask, moves like a , a , or a  onstage.Even better: Lorde is more than merely an antidote for late-capitalist pop and its sometimes desperate way with bass frequencies. She's a —and a startlingly adept one at that. Beaming Drake's hyper-self-awareness through a surreal suburban lens, she makes house parties, high school crushes, and aimless drives along tree-lined streets sound like mystical rites of passage (which, of course, they are). ""One day the blood won't flow so gladly,"" she sings near the end of , touching-up her goth eyeliner, ""One day we'll all get still."" Given this subtly momentous debut album, though, there's reason to believe Lorde has many musical lives left to live. —Ryan DombalLorde: "
,Perfect Pussy,I have lost all desire for feeling,self-released,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"The squirmy responses to Perfect Pussy's name always remind me of something a member of embattled Russian punk collective Pussy Riot about their own moniker: ""In Russia, they're much more afraid of the word 'riot.' In America, they seem to be more afraid of the other word."" And like their handle, ’s sound is confrontational, but not in the usual sense. We expect music this loud to be bleak, violent, and nihilistic, but instead this Syracuse five-piece specializes in something even more subversive: a kind of radical positivity. Perfect Pussy rose from the ashes of the New York hardcore band Shoppers, whose phenomenally pummeling debut LP was inscribed with an unexpectedly hopeful epigram: ""You cannot defeat the darkness, you can only be the light."" That also feels like a fitting tagline for , Perfect Pussy's four-song debut demo tape. Frontwoman Meredith Graves has these songs “happy revelations about incendiary events”—after the shit-storm, a rapturous calm. Clocking in just shy of 13 minutes, the EP feels like the sustained climax of a horror movie, the aural equivalent of that moment when the heroine—tattered, bleeding, and suddenly superhumanly defiant—drives the devil out and is engulfed in a radioactive glow. Instead of crosses, garlic, or the Holy Spirit, Perfect Pussy are armed with gunmetal guitar tones, blindingly luminous keyboards, and Graves' euphoric-as-fuck shouts: “I am full of light/ I am full of light/ I am full of light/ I am filled with joy.” They’re Eastern mystics disguised as Upstate punks; Perfect Pussy want to kill you with kindness. —Lindsay ZoladzPerfect Pussy: "

Parquet Courts are staunchly image-conscious about not having an image whatsoever, and on they perhaps accidentally dial in on that miracle middleground between art school and the CBGB’s bathroom, Malkmus and ""New Rose"".What pushes the trio beyond their peers is a preternatural ability to locate the exact second when teenage kicks give way to a realization of their place in the world—the time when you critically analyze the deeper meaning of the junk in your pockets. The first 5:42 of the record, among the best 1-2 punches of the year, outlines the alpha and omega of their response to their life station: sarcasm and nostalgia. “Master of My Craft” blasts “Ex-Lion Tamer” through Jonathan Richman’s car stereo, with co-frontman Austin Brown’s manifesto sounds made via cut-up method from a publicist’s Linkedin account. Then a single drumstick click smash-cuts into “Borrowed Time”, on which Andrew Savage perfectly encapsulates inspiration arising from squalor—thoughts dripping on his head from the ceiling.Then there’s the dopey majesty of “Stoned and Starving”, the “Hallogallo” of slack-jawed bakedom, barreling into an unknown future where you’re still high as fuck. It’s 2013’s “Nothing Ever Happened”, if everything actually did happen right behind you and you were too completely blazed to turn around at the bodega counter. “I don’t know too much, I just got the keys,” Brown sings on “Yr No Stoner”. Now, to find the car. —Eric Harvey

40,Ty Segall,Manipulator,Drag City,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"In the time it takes you to read this, Ty Segall will have likely written five new songs, if not recorded another full-length album. As one of rock’s most productive and prolific artists, Segall manages to outpace his peers in terms of pure volume and (most of the time) in quality. The breakneck speed at which Segall produced his earlier material was often reflected in the recordings, which frequently rejected polish in favor of rapidly recorded fuzz. In contrast, —which boasts 17 tracks written and recorded over a span of 14 months—is the most meticulously crafted thing Segall has ever released, an extended play synthesis of literally everything that he does so well. Though his aesthetic generally remains buried in a dirty garage located someplace in the early '70s, Segall’s knack for whipping up airtight hooks and kooky turns of phrase save his takes on psych-glam-garage-boogie from sounding like overly-serious Jack White-style pastiche. While the album doesn’t scrimp when it comes to serving the amped up scuzz-rawk rippers that fans have come to expect from him,  gets extra interesting when Segall shows off his more pastoral side. If there’s a problem with  it’s just that the record is almost too much of a good thing—too many competing vibes corralled into one stall, too many single-worthy tracks in one place fighting for air. —T.

Tim Beeler whispers and rants and crows and sings (the latter only sometimes, and unspectacularly), earning himself a spot alongside Protomartyr's Joe Casey as one of the best everyman frontmen we've got.

,The Flaming Lips,The Terror,Bella Union / Warner Bros.,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Ladies and gentlemen, they are floating in space: Paring down the full-frontal attack of 2009’s to a sparse arrangement of space-travel rhythms and industrial synths, the Lips’ latest evokes a curious sense of weightlessness, both physical and emotional. It’s as though they’ve soundtracked an alternate version of that follows George Clooney into the abyss and watches him suffocate. This is relentlessly bleak music; we’ve heard the band in this mode before, but they’ve never sustained it for so long without countering the desolation with moments of jubilation or catharsis. Rather than utterly hopeless, however, sounds oddly triumphant even without Steven Drozd’s distorted drums, even without Wayne Coyne’s goofy optimism, even without any big moments that would normally warrant a giant crowd-surfing hamster ball. Our ability to experience an emotion as intense and as visceral as existential terror is cause for some kind of celebration. —Stephen M. DeusnerThe Flaming Lips: "
,Ty Segall,Sleeper,Drag City,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"Having released three full-length records and a number of singles last year, Ty Segall earned a nice long break… of a few months. By springtime, he was already back to work, announcing , a collection of moody and minimalist acoustic songsthe hushed to his triple year. The LP, which was recorded at home and on the quick, documents an emotionally intense period in the garage-rocker’s life, which included the passing of his father, major family struggles, and the transition from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The cathartic aspects of the recording add depth to its appeal, but would be just as engaging sans backstory. It’s a quiet and eerie set of songs, with Segall doubling his falsetto vocals to the point of near-inscrutability and subtly blurring the largely acoustic instrumentation with warbly electronic effects and mild distortion. Volume and velocity have been an important part of Segall’s music, but as a songwriter, he’s grown a lot since his early records, developing a unique and wonky perspectivewhere serious relationship issues could be effectively communicated with a song about finding an adequate sofa, for instance. makes it more obvious that, while Segall remains really good at yelling, he doesn’t have to do it forever if he doesn’t want to.

He pairs emotionally vulnerable sentiments with vocals largely untouched by pitch-correcting software.

,William Tyler,Impossible Truth,Merge,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"An unlikely glut of instrumental guitar records (including great ones from Nathan Salsburg, Daniel Bachman, and Cian Nugent) were released in 2013; most were indebted, in one way or another, to John Fahey, who championed a finger-picking style that was rooted in the country-blues but allowed for all sorts of oddball dissonance in the 50s. Fahey called the style American Primitivism, and it repositioned the unaccompanied guitar as an able purveyor of idiosyncratic, non-verbal narratives. , the second LP from Nashville guitarist William Tyler, is full of those kinds of stories, told wordlessly but remarkably well—each of the record’s singular tracks contains an entire universe of devastations, ecstasies, and resolutions. Tyler is a skilled and artful musician—and the atmospheric bits he layers on top of his compositions are undeniably good—but there’s something particularly stunning about the way these songs move: Tyler understands that the human experience is more about the small shifts, the little changes and stumbles and victories, all the things that repeat and start over anew.  comes about as close as anyone could hope to approximating the sound of living a life. —Amanda Petrusich

,Young Thug,1017 Thug,Brick Squad Monopoly,Staff Lists: Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention,"After years of kicking around the perpetually regenerating Atlanta youth rap community—Rich Kidz, Travis Porter, etc.—and fusing their aesthetic with a sort of Lil Wayne-light sensibility, Young Thug had a breakout and break-everything year. , his first (and last?) effort under Gucci Mane's Brick Squad, firmly establishes Thug as one of rap's most thrilling innovators. He rhymes in tiny explosions, shifting cadences as if the room was running out of air. In today's conservative rap landscape, this reads as eccentricity; back in the day, it would have just been called “style.” And while there are definitely traces of pure, unhinged Ol' Dirty Bastard-type madness in his work, he's also carefully controlled. He changes language to accommodate his ideas, rather than adapting his ideas to fit the laws of language, moving daisy-chained word associations that hover on the outer perimeters of logic and traditional syntax: ""I'm a Seahawk in a flying coupe/ I'll Seattle you I'll paddle you/ Like a biker seat I'll saddle you/ Like an earthquake shake salad you."" In his best moments, Thug is writing in a sphere closer to Ghostface or De La Soul than the modern-day trap stars he'll inevitably be lumped in with. At a time when the biggest rap stars are selling reserved eloquence and the cult of lyricism is tipping the genre towards literalism, Young Thug is exactly the rapper the world needs—one whose performance hits you in the throat immediately but whose wordplay demands close attention. —Andrew Nosnitsky

39,A$AP Rocky,LongLiveA$AP,Polo Grounds / RCA,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Although it seemed like the long-awaited culmination of a two-year narrative when it came out, A$AP Rocky's proper debut surprisingly managed to, in many ways, set the tone for the year ahead in hip-hop. It is a cool album, exactingly deliberate and consistent in its construction, yet effortless in its handle on the zeitgeist. Other rappers borrowed the album's visual aesthetic and made album covers in grayscale; other kids borrowed the A$AP look and flooded rap shows in their screen printed shorts. And make no mistake, it's Rocky's love of screwed down vocals specifically that helped the effect seep into the DNA of so many Soundcloud producers.  projects a sense of unruffled self-assurance and flawless taste that's easy to latch onto. Many of its best moments hinge on other artists—Drake and Kendrick Lamar's breezily confident verses on ""Fuckin' Problems"", a succession of scene-stealing guest spots on ""1 Train"", Skrillex's batshit production on ""Wild for the Night"", the eerie juxtaposition of Santigold and Clams Casino on ""Hell"", Gunplay's demand for a porterhouse steak—but these never fail to read as anything other than an expert work of curation on Rocky's part. Whether he's rapping slick bars about fashion, bluntly dismissing racial prejudice, or simply ceding the stage to his talented friends, he's at the center of things, the image of unflappable coolness. And rap, it happens, is pretty great when it's acting cool. —Kyle Kramer"

From the release of their fourth full-length in 15 years as well as the corresponding reissue of their major EPs and LPs, through to an accompanying marketing campaign that prompted BoC fans to roll out their tinfoil hats, protractors, and astrology wheels in the name of a fresh clue, the brothers Sandison enjoyed a prolific year that thrust them back into the spotlight and cemented their status as a legacy act. is neither as deep nor as nuanced as their previous records, but it should go down as a worthy contribution to that legacy. In addition to magnanimously calling back to some of the brothers’ biggest moments (see: “Palace Posy” as a companion piece to 1998’s “Aquarius”, “New Seeds” to 2006’s “Dayvan Cowboy”, etc.), it also offered up a new shade to Boards of Canada’s sound, one that married their familiar whirly-gigging synths and loping rhythm sections with yawning horrorshow arpeggios and a faint undercurrent of dread. It's thrilling to hear these new themes of death and decay slowly seep into the dominant dewey-eyed late-90s nostalgia narrative; one wonders what they’d sound like if they went digging even deeper into the dirtMark Pytlik

The album even begins with the sound of Hopkins unlocking his studio door before settling into a beat that scuffs up his pristine ambience with a new intensity. The for  highlight  perhaps best demonstrates this. A kid skateboards smoothly through time and space, the camera focusing on the scene’s grit: his black eye and bandaged wrist, a flaming tire, a man on fire, abandoned townships. His constant forward motion is soothing to watch even as moments of unease keep it from being just another beautifully shot video. Between the piano interludes of “Breathe This Air” and labored breaths permeating the crunchy, simmering “Collider”, also lurches from pretty to pinprickly, taking the listener on a similarly fantastic journey through Hopkins' brilliant mind. —Harley Brown

Such a forceful sentiment might sound overbearing if  wasn’t so insistently and so genuinely compassionate, if the synths didn’t sound so massively sparkly on “Tether”, if the choruses of “The Mother We Share” didn’t scale monumental heights. Before forming Chvrches, these three Glaswegians all had a jump on becoming jaded insiders: Iain Cook and Martin Doherty paid dues in Aerogramme and the Twilight Sad, respectively, and Mayberry, in addition to serving time in a twee-folk act, had studied music journalism. Yet, there was something refreshing and deeply moving about Chvrches in 2013. They wore their hearts on their sleeves and risked falling on their faces, but succeeds precisely because it sounds so musically and spiritually generous. These songs are far too ambitious to be mere comfort food, and the trio are too concerned about each and every one of you to care much about any particular trends or scenes. —Stephen M.

Instead, they were gentle nudges, reminders of an album that requires patience due to its unusual way of establishing a relationship with the listener. The band shares its most intimate secrets first: you immediately hear Nicole Miglis completely exposed with an a cappella prayer, there’s conspiratory laughter, a scrambled Skype conversation with her partner on ""Broken Blue"", police sirens ringing outside their downtown Los Angeles apartment during the mesmerizing gospel of ""Murmurs"". Once they’ve earned your trust, Hundred Waters makes dazzling third, 12th, and 25th impressions, as the confluence of their astounding technical proficiency and boundless sonic scope somehow manages to be subtle.  is a bold, confident album that still plays coy—""I wish you would see what I see,"" Miglis sings on ""Murmurs"".

At one, you've got Garrett Koloski bringing up the drums, shifting tempos and hammering fills like he's escaping an oncoming firestorm. At the other, Meredith Graves pounds her voice into the ground. Between them, squalls of guitars and synthesizers fan each other's flames. No one makes it out in one piece.Graves' language takes patience to decode and it's worth it: Her lyrics are the key to sinking this record into your bones. ""I have a history of surrender,"" she declares on ""Driver"". ""I eat stress and I shit blood/ And buddy, I'll tell you, it never gets better."" She runs down a list of lies, ""lies like I will be protected."" On ""Interference Fits"", she sings, ""I met my despair at midday light/ And it was amazing, and I almost cried"". comes with a question mark hanging invisibly at the end of its title, but its reluctance to embrace love unequivocally only strengthens its refusal to accept woundedness as a defining state. Graves sings like a person who's been hurt, again and again, from all angles in a country that systemically dehumanizes women, queers, and anyone else who doesn't play by the status quo. But she sings like she's found power in that hurt. She refuses defeat with every syllable.  is the sound of someone looking deep inside themselves and realizing what they thought was broken is actually a source of strength—and then making a whole lot of triumphant noise about it. —Sasha Geffen

How did she get it so right? By taking cues from that aesthetic but not letting it define her. The record is submerged in beats that slur and slosh, with Tinashe’s breathy vocals never sinking too deep. This is a decidedly of-the-moment LP, but it succeeds the same way any good R&B album does: with generous songwriting and strong singing. ""2 On"", one of the finest singles of the year, is instructive in this sense—every part of the song is sung so distinctly that it feels like the choruses of a bunch of tracks were ripped away and fused together.It’s easy to let your head swim through , but Tinashe announces herself as its centerpiece throughout, from her slight falsetto on the slippery ""Feels Like Vegas"" to the '90s throwback belter ""Thug Cry"".

35,Shabazz Palaces,Lese Majesty,Sub Pop,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014," is Shabazz Palaces getting interstellar, a set of intricate, enigmatic, yet meaningful suites complete with an (initially) impenetrable multidimensional blueprint/map connecting it all in the liner notes. Beneath the visuals, the album contends with a strain of Afrofuturism that puts its faith in finding unities in contradictions and clarity in riddles (""I'm having my cake and I'm eating cake,"" ""facts stated to enhance what is pre-born,"" ""we try to unreproduce six tension intervals""), reconciling structure and formlessness, forethought and spontaneity. Attempting to transcend the physical yet being constantly aware of how that physicality is constantly being threatened is a hell of an undertaking—more apparent this year, though nothing new. Here the state is depicted in hip-hop revelation story ""...down 155th in the MCM Snorkel"" as ""Escaping the bleak, pursuing a feeling/ Pressure pushed them towards the instinct of brilliance."" Those unwary peers who lived through those same origins but shrug that brilliant instinct off are damned to the tune of meter-defying breaks and tactile, synthesized bass-church/musique concrète production that turns human language into primordial elements of cosmic influence. It's humbling stuff that urges you to dance but knows full well that, to do so, you'll need to relearn new and better steps. —Nate Patrin

34,Cloud Nothings,Here and Nowhere Else,Carpark / Mom & Pop,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"If 2012’s  was the moment where Dylan Baldi’s bedroom-project-turned-power-trio first flashed its surprisingly sharp teeth,  is the sound of Cloud Nothings gnawing on flesh and drawing blood, inflicting wounds both physical and psychic. This is an album that begins with a bruising rumble (""Now Hear In"") and then, over the course of a breathless eight songs and 32 minutes, just turns more feral and ferocious as it exposes the cruel irony of a relationship’s end: i.e., that it really just marks the start of a whole new round of head games and deceptions. Despite the album’s frenetic, intensifying momentum, the overall feeling is one of crippling dysfunction, best summed up by Baldi’s agitated, laryngitis-inducing howl on ""No Thoughts"" (""You don’t really seem to care/ And I don’t even talk about it""), where he effectively loses his shit over an ex’s inability to give a shit about him pretending to not give a shit. But remarkably, the more aggressive and unhinged Cloud Nothings get, the sharper Baldi’s melodic instincts become: In its first 100 seconds alone, the closing pop-punk pick-me-up ""I’m Not Part of Me"" swiftly cycles through two alternate verse/chorus pairings that could each handily support their own stand-alone song. Really, Cloud Nothings’ fourth album could not have been more appropriately titled:  is the most relentlessly single-minded, maniacally focussed indie rock album released this year—a break-up record pitched at breakneck speed, blurring the line between introspection and insanity. —Stuart Berman

35,Phosphorescent,Muchacho,Dead Oceans,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"The gatefold of  features a detail shot of a Nudie suit. The background is dark, and there’s a peacock framed by light purple flowers. It’s not nearly as colorful or garish as Gram Parsons’ iconic drug cornucopia pattern. This one’s unassuming, feasibly the sort of thing you could wear out of a Western clothing shop without looking like a cartoon cowboy. Matthew Houck is embracing his country roots, but he never plays them up to the point of honky tonk hucksterism. Fiddles, piano, pedal steel, even horseshoe-clopping percussion are all implemented on his new album, but they’re never the focal point. Houck’s band on  have chops, but they never show off. When Kyle Resnick plays his trumpet, the sound doesn’t blare—it’s nestled beneath Houck’s ragged, seemingly sleepy vocal. Everything’s tempered, supplemental, and gorgeously produced by John Agnello.is full of allegory, with lyrics about “the wounded master,” rolling away the stone, the shepherd, the lamb, and so on. These are reasonably common lyrical tropes in country and folk traditions, and Houck balances those moments with more familiarly contemporary imagery. On “Down to Go”, he sings about partying to numb the hurt, and all the while, he openly acknowledges the social stereotypes that come with being a heartbroken country balladeer. While his friends tell him he’ll write some great music about his heartache, he points out that he’s still hurting, “aching and ornery.” Over Ricky Jay Jackson’s looming pedal steel, he paints a picture that’s bruised and familiar. It makes sense why this album’s origin story—Houck's break up and trip to Mexico—is frequently referenced when  is discussed. The record's sentiments and backstory pair well, sort of like  and Justin Vernon’s Wisconsin cabin. —Evan Minsker

34,Forest Swords,Engravings,Tri Angle,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"No-one does atmosphere like Forest Swords. The Manchester producer excels at evoking shades and shadows, slippery feelings, and the yawning, life-sized chasm between doom and triumph. On his debut album , he fulfills the early promise of his 2010 EP, , by carving out a fully inhabitable world from such fertile matter. Throughout, the drums are slow and steady, observing time in an offhand yet hypnotizing manner. Pipes call out in celebration, and in warning. Guitar lines curl ominously. All criss-cross in what feels like a deeply meaningful yet undefinable way. Forest Swords is not interested in telling a story, it seems, but in making the listener an unquestionable part of it. Like its predecessor,  occupies nameless territory. One minute it sounds like a forgotten Eastern folk music, the next the soundtrack to a Leone western, and the next again like the future memories of music our children’s children will one day have. It’s this fluidity that is at the heart of the album’s power. Nameless, placeless, timeless:  rejects boundaries and scrabbles to unearth the subconscious instead. —Ruth Saxelby

Ever since he emerged in 2005, the man known as William Emmanuel Bevan () has operated according to his own tenets. At the end of 2012, for instance, he released the staggering two-track, 25-minute “Truant/ Rough Sleeper”, which continued to resonate through this year. Comprised of crackling, forlorn, hoar-frosted etudes that faded together into a dream-logical suite, Burial’s acumen isolated these voices calling from a post- world and made them into something harrowing yet ultimately redemptive.

Following almost a decade of remixes and sporadic singles, the solo collection  blew his cover. A long, ink-smudged love letter to dance music, friends, and living gently, its excesses are charming: rhythms tumbling off one too many glasses of wine, fidgety synths too cavalier with scented candles. The lightly stepping ""La Duequesa"" features steel drums  swelling Motown strings. There's a weird-uncle vibe to the proceedings, from the preposterous art to the normally pompadoured-and-leather-jacketed Matthew Dear singing ""It's a serious world/ I'm a magical boy."" Later, another Dear track offers Koze acolytes a mantra: ""When I notice the world is falling apart/ I will run a bath.""

31,Autre Ne Veut,Anxiety,Mexican Summer / Software,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"2013 may very well stand as the year the word ""literally"" lost its meaning, or at least the year where it was redefined to include its misuse as a tool for melodramatic overstatements. Autre Ne Veut's  is a crashing, clanging, caterwauling expression of this sort of literally. It is music for literally feeling torn apart inside, for literally feeling like the world is collapsing. It is not safe; it is not proper; it is not tastefully reserved. It's very real and very raw. In a year in which blogs were littered with electronically tinged distortions of R&B and synthpop in a similar vein to Autre Ne Veut,  discarded the form's prevailing principle of slick prettiness for uninhibited, pure emotion. Sure, the results are melodramatic, but that's how big emotions are portrayed. You don't stand in front of the mirror and think ""someday I'm gonna die"" to yourself, as singer Arthur Ashin does on ""Gonna Die"" and not play it up a little, even if you totally mean it. You don't curl up in bed and whimper ""don't ever leave me alone"" into the phone with any sort of decorum.  is fists-clenched, teary-eyed catharsis, whether in the feedback screeches and false optimism of ""Counting"", the careening guitar riffs in the back of ""Ego Free Sex Free"", or the crescendoed crash of tour de force opener ""Play by Play"".

These are two young black men who hail from Atlanta and rap about everything. It's not just that they cover a wide variety of subject matter that rotates on a song-to-song basis, but that every single song they make seems to touch on their entire spread of thoughts and emotions. In a matter of a seconds, a tender Rich Gang ballad can fill up with seething death threats, or a string of superficial boasts can flip to reveal a moment of absolute vulnerability. Sometimes, they massage these shifts subtly with melodic cues or vocal tics; sometimes, they move about through more traditional means of lyricism. In the middle of ""Hate I"", a track that is ostensibly about hating to fall in love with pussy, Quan blurts out ""I just wanna live"" and stretches the last two syllables across three bars. This should be enough to send chills up even the numbest of spines in this terrible world, where the right to be and stay alive is not always granted to young men of Quan’s complexion. But then the other Givenchy drops and his voice cracks and ""don’t give no fucks ’bout who I kill"" comes out of the speaker, and it’s hard to know what to feel other than still completely crushed. is Quan and Thug's first collaborative tape and it's the most complete project that either has been involved with to date.

Of course the grand acts of big city rebellion on Taylor Swift’s fifth album are hilariously PG: ""Oh yeah? You think I’m demure? Well how ‘bout I ?"" The entire premise—that  is Swift’s ""first official, documented pop album""—rests on a similarly crafty fallacy, that her catalog hasn’t been shaped by whip-smart pop instincts all along. It’s that patented humblebrag pantomime again: ""Little ol’ me? A pop star?""It’s so perfect, though—that Swift’s big-deal stylistic pivot is, in fact, utterly -transgressive. In reality,  isn’t such a departure from the glossier moments of : conversational but crisp, informed but not steered by Max Martin, yuppie in spite of a preoccupation with social hierarchy. Still, if Swift insists she is now a pop star, let it be known that she does ""pop star"" better than any of her peers, with the knowing passive-aggression of a student who’d rather quietly carry a group project than tell her classmates they’re doing it all wrong. This strategic coyness can be Swift’s most maddening quality, but on , she  it unlike ever before, popping the Chandon with a big ol’ wink for all the Crazy Bitches to clink to the douchebags’ toasts. She’s harnessed the power of her all-consuming self-awareness, investing in the meme economy with quivering poker-face, her returns matched only by Drake’s: if they hate, then let ‘em hate, and watch the ""basic bitch"" think pieces pile up. Is there any doubt she knew full well, on ""Blank Space"", how uncannily ""long list of ex-lovers"" sounded like ""lonely Starbucks lovers""?Those who accuse Swift of ironing out her narratives on  aren’t wrong: those efficiently personal details once stitched into her songwriting have been democratized. But it’s unrealistic to frame this as selling out. (Taylor Swift does not sell out. She sells more.) Maybe, instead, it’s the realization that obsessive mythologizing of past and future is way less fun than having tons of sex and carting your cat around New York City. To be clear:  Swift’s New York is not the city where you buy loosies from the corner bodega, and it is certainly not the city where police murdered Eric Garner in cold blood for allegedly selling them. Swift’s New York involves some tricky camera angles:  of the festive Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, the surrounding protest signs conveniently just out of frame.

Gentle Ben he is not, and when we last heard Deerhunter on 2013’s , they’d acquired an aggressiveness that reflected Cox’s antagonism toward social complacency.Then, Cox was seriously injured after being hit by a car in late 2014. The incident gave him some perspective, and presaged Deerhunter’s return to a softer, psychedelic, unabashedly gorgeous sound. Call it the cosmic Americana: ’s influences are hook-heavy, radio-friendly rock acts like Tom Petty and R.E.M., as refracted through the prism of Deerhunter’s weirdness. It sounds like light emitting from the stars, framing Cox’s preoccupation with mortality—a recurring theme for the band, but now contextualized by a literal bodily threat. He worries about going to the old folks’ home, and asks how to conquer the the fear that consumes his day-to-day. ""I’ve spent all of my time chasing the fading frontier,"" he sings, afraid of giving up after coming so far. On that song, he chants ""I’m living my life"" over and over, like a man hypnotized into a routine.But all that heightened sensitivity doesn’t mean Deerhunter’s lost its nerve. ""Snakeskin"" is one of the friskiest songs they’ve ever written; its first lines, ""I was born already nailed to the cross/ I was born with a feeling I was lost,"" could open one of Faulkner’s Southern gothics. They still sound like Deerhunter, basically—older, and a little worse for the wear, but on their feet. They feel the black shroud at all moments, but they’re finding a way to live.

Yet there was the triumphant black student body of the University of Missouri,  to celebrate successful protests against campus racism. A silly song, maybe, but one that brought light!It’s too soon to say for sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a similar fate befell the brothers Sremm, who dropped the year’s most exuberant, hit-heavy rap album in the first week of January so that everyone else could spend the rest of the year geting esoteric and emo. The duo’s sound is darker than F.L.Y.’s, but they share a distinct  ethos: a pious devotion to partying, dumb jokes, casual (protected!) sex, and everything else great about being a young adult with newfound disposable income.  was a burst of minimalist stadium-trap, ecstatic -core EDM, and giddy strip club joints with secret Jeremih bridges.

Even now, 11 months after its release, it still sounds jarring, corroded and full of fight. finds Sleater-Kinney pile-driving through corrupt power and fear, through the enablers of mediocrity. It's a timeless record about a marginalized struggle—a song like ""Fangless"", about the impotence of patriarchy, will never go out of style—though its nuanced take on liberation is novel. Sleater-Kinney may fight back and celebrate togetherness, but they also illuminate the ongoing battles inherent in sustaining pleasure: the way love can become ""a ritual of emptiness,"" the loneliness of ""the shout of a room.""

That swaggering openness to unlimited possibility was what made Sleater-Kinney's comeback so potent. They returned to see what they would become, rather than to rehash what they had been. —Laura Snapes

The gut-wrenching noise that spills forth from lead singer's George Clarke’s throat transcends its tone of shrieking menace, his lines filled with unsettlingly beautiful imagery: man’s passion being carried off ""by some lonely driver in a line of fluorescent light,"" humanity’s ""ugliness stretching toward the chandelier."" But Deafheaven don't just rattle off romanticist tropes, and the narrative power of  has a strength that’s independent of its lyrics. They illustrate and expound upon the words with huge shifts in dynamic range, from the sublime crescendoes at the heart of ""Luna"" or cross-genre experiments like the post-rock meeting gritty thrash on ""Baby Blue"".

That sentiment does not apply to his previous work: his violent and fantastical debut mixtape , and 2013's , a playground of wordplay with a wide range of beats. It was a foreshadowing for the album that was to come, one that finds Earl more focused than he's ever been as a lyricist, songwriter, and producer.In his own words, Earl is ""grown."" For him, being an adult means he takes responsibility for his actions (""Trying to pay my momma rent, figured that's just what I owe her""), guards himself from outsiders (""I only trust these bitches 'bout as far as I can throw 'em""), and maintains a thorough work ethic (""My days numbered/ I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em""). In addition to what he's saying, Earl's also condensed how he's saying it. He still has the ability to spin dizzying internal and end rhymes, but instead chooses to emphasize diction, clarity, and pacing to truly emphasize the gravity of his words.  captures a particular moment and specific murky, grated sound, in which it revels for only about 30 minutes.  is a just brief foray into Earl's psyche, but it might be as long as he can handle someone else in his head. —Matthew Strauss"

As sure as you’re reading this, you will die, and you can only hope for a peaceful transition to the other side. Thundercat has been preoccupied with the topic for the past few years: 2013’s  was shaded by the death of his friend and collaborator, , and his work on Flying Lotus’  helped convey what the spirit might endure as the body passes away.But while FlyLo used frenetic psych-jazz to conceptualize death, Thundercat takes a reflective stance on , using improvised funk and R&B to mourn. On ""Hard Times"", Thundercat channels what the soul must feel when death takes hold. By the last song, ""Where the Giants Roam"", he’s at peace with the afterlife, even if the journey is unclear: ""Nothing in this world I know/ Can you tell me who you are?""  continued where left off, when the pain of dying fades and the darkness slowly sets in.Thundercat’s EP helped cement a great year for Lotus’ Brainfeeder label. Along with , the bassist appeared frequently on Kamasi Washington’s  and Kendrick Lamar’s , two landmark albums that celebrated blackness and kept jazz at the forefront. Thundercat was especially brave on , walking through a world many of us don’t want to acknowledge and making it sing. —Marcus J. Moore

Recorded mostly at night, partly in the desert, and buttressed by banjo and piano, it's a quiet, hold-you-close record that goes easy on the effects, and values presence above all else. Incongruously, it's also fueled by jokes. Vile has always been sly, but here, as often as not, he's a real knee-slapper, whether it's his headache ""like a shop vac coughin' dust bunnies"" or a lyrical cameo from the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man—and that in the album’s emotional center of gravity, too: ""That's Life, tho (almost hate to say)"", a bittersweet bout of philosophizing that doubles as a eulogy. His acid sense of humor lies just beneath the surface of his idiosyncratic tone—a drawl that shifts between Leonard Cohen and Joey Ramone and Bob Dylan and Black Francis—and it surfaces unexpectedly in his odd stresses and enjambments, his quixotic determination to squeeze any thought into the space of a bar, to hell with the rhythmic feet.""Hopefully I just get a little more fine-tuned and a little more real and vulnerable all the time,"" Vile told the , trying to pinpoint what was different with this album. Which brings us to ""Wild Imagination"" and one of the best lines on the whole record: ""I'm afraid that I am feeling much too many feelings simultaneously, at such a rapid clip."" It's the game face he wears when feeling those feelings, and staring down that fear, that makes  such a delight. —Philip Sherburne"
22,Panda Bear,Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper,Domino,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Years ago, a friend and I half-jokingly came up with a genre to describe how Noah Lennox always sounded like he was singing while stuck down a very deep well: cavewave. In 2015, it doesn’t seem like Lennox ever emerged from the underground. His music as Panda Bear is hallucinatory and slippery, always on the verge of dissolving into shadow while still managing to keep a firm foot on the ground. He doesn’t literally come face-to-face with Death on , but the album hides his increasingly adult concerns—fatherhood, middle age, his dog—within all that melodic weirdness. On its most haunting track, ""Tropic of Cancer"", he sings about watching his father submit to brain cancer, a harp looping against what sounds like wind blowing through the trees. Lennox, whose koan-like observations have never suffered from obfuscation, beautifully sums up how the death of a close one sections off a life we knew: ""You can’t come back to it.""The shortest song on the album takes its name from , a video game about a young man who navigates a mysterious land in search of nameless monsters. The protagonist’s name is Wander, fittingly, because you’ll walk and walk and walk, exploring your surroundings with no destination in sight. It’s how I see Lennox: an explorer moving through the fog, bumping into life’s overwhelming realities and finding a way to meet the challenge. —Jeremy Gordon

21,Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment,Surf,self-released,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"The most important song on , the blindingly optimistic album that Chicago icon Chance the Rapper released this year with his crew instead of a proper solo follow up to , is called ""Wanna Be Cool"". That’s because the chorus is ""I don’t wanna be cool,"" repeated joyously and relentlessly, and the rest of  drives this point home with the zeal of an anti-drug a cappella group invading your fifth-grade lunchroom.Consider: Chance made this album with a guy who goes by the name ""Donnie Trumpet,"" which wouldn’t even be a cool sobriquet among marching-band geeks. He invited goofballs like Big Sean to do fake-Lyricist Lounge raps on it (""My older bro was on the honor roll/ And the other one was always up in front of the honor, so/ I’m in the middle like the lining of divide signs"") and got current-day Busta Rhymes to sound  (on ""Slip Slide""). He snagged the funniest verse King Louie spit all year (""If your bitch from Paris, then Paris is terrible"") and put it on a pop song that sounds like a circa-'99 Sugar Ray single. The album makes your cheeks hurt; it feels like doing the chicken dance at your cousin’s wedding.This energy is Chance the Rapper’s gift to the universe, the superpower he brings to rap. ""Don’t you look up to me...if you learn one thing today,"" he chides tenderly. The album has the aura of the kind of big brother you fantasize about even if you have a big brother: wise, funny, concerned, engaged, no-bullshit, authoritative but equal. And it is so committed and nuanced, even with all of this sunshine, that it reminds you that joy is an emotion with millions of gradations, a feeling you can soak in, nurse, and cultivate the same way you might do with melancholy. —Jayson Greene

On the Danish band’s , a stunning collection of loose, rollicking punk jams, Rønnenfelt sings mostly about being extraordinarily angry: ""I don’t care whose house is on fire, as long as I can warm myself at the blaze,"" he announces in the somersaulting opener ""On My Fingers"". Rønnenfelt’s mania can be terrifying, but there’s beauty in his rage, too, like on the piano-addled ""Against the Moon"", in which he sounds defeated and morose, dragged along by a cluster of low, droning horns. What’s most important, though, is that Rønnenfelt’s not sorry, not even a little bit: ""Whatever I do, I do not repent,"" he shrugs. —Amanda Petrusich"
29,How to Dress Well,"""What Is This Heart?""",Domino / Weird World,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Tom Krell’s third album as How to Dress Well is a brave confession. It is radically, exposing-the-fifth-dimension honest. It is perm-era Whitney Houston as a white boy cooing about the power of powerlessness. It is teenage angst simmering into adult anguish. It is Young Thug poring over the sublime with Immanuel Kant. It is emo, R&B, and post-taste pop built for imaginary charts. It is a couple million copies away from a ""What Is This Fart?"" ""Weird Al"" parody. It is as serious as . It promises to stay before it leaves. It is the tinny on-hold music that makes you want to run away with him forever. It seeks love in a world full of ""love."" It is a bad dream that feels too real. It respects family enough to tell them the truth. It’s self-help with a brain and blood.

Margaret Chardiet of Pharmakon understands this. But in her world, the enemy is the self. Her grisly album covers (featuring maggots and animal organs), song titles (""Body Betrays Itself""), and frank  provide context for her particular take on noise music, but even without all that, it's obvious that this is music about pain.There's a mysterious connection between pain and sound: When our bodies experience trauma, we remember buzzes, bells, clicks; we remember our own voices, even when they sound like they come from far away. On her second LP, Chardiet coughs, hacks, spits, and screeches, as metal-on-metal clangs hammer beneath her. It's music about living inside your body and feeling revulsion, but despite the horror, there's also something comforting there, a shared space for raw experience that feels transformative. One of the paradoxical qualities of extreme noise music is that when it reaches a certain volume, you feel utterly alone, cut off from the world. It explains how harsh tones can obliterate thought and become meditative. But if you're wired a certain way, Chardiet's noise music is relatable. She enters a hyper-intense world on , and you are right there with her. —Mark Richardson

27,YG,My Krazy Life,Def Jam,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"YG hails from Compton, California and, like more than a few of his fellow Comptonites, he is what you would call a gangsta rapper. In fact, his debut album  is the first pure gangsta rap album to be released on a major label in many years. (And the way the triple beams have been tipping, it might also be the last.) It meets both the literal definition of the genre—YG boasts constantly about his Blood affiliations—and also the classical one. This is not the all-too-common contemporary sort of braggadocious street rap where death and wealth are used as competitive or stylistic props. This is narrative, panoramic, and consequence-driven hip-hop in the vein of '90s legends like MC Eiht and Spice 1.Frighteningly efficient hitmaker DJ Mustard handles the bulk of the production and, as with everything he has thrown to market this year, these are sparse and formulaic party records—four to five notes played with one finger that hang in the air until his ubiquitous  drop summons the 808s. But he saves his best work for the homie here, and fleshes that skeleton out with an appropriately haunting layer of wheezy G-Funk nostalgia. YG maximizes this minimalism with snarling flows and writes in a smart, simple voice that serves pride, drama, and regret in equal doses. That's roughly the path his thinly constructed storyline follows, too, from neighborhood anthems to carefully executed heists to the inevitable sad phone calls to mom from lock-up. Despite its turn-up functionality,  is a tragedy at its core. It's a record about a life from which escape (or even escapism) is not an option, where one's best hope is to live long enough to apologize. —Andrew Nosnitsky"

This seems to happen a lot; the leadoff track to —Timony's 2005 solo LP, from which her newest band took their name—found Timony stepping over a warm body en route to the Corn Chex and, nine years later, there they are again, sprawled out all over  highlight ""Waterfall"". This is the point where I remind you of Timony's long tenure as a musician, scratch my head over the untimely demise of the one-and-done Wild Flag, or rattle off all the Ford-and-Carter-era classic-rock touchstones to whom Ex Hex raise their denim-encircled fists. But nuts to that: with , Timony, Laura Harris, and Betsy Wright made themselves an all-killer, no-filler power-pop record, the kind that's far too fun to get bogged down with details like ""who’s ripping off whom?"" or ""want me to call you a cab?""  is a promise delivered, a dozen songs you swear you’ve heard before but you never quite seem to get sick of. Ex Hex's dispatches from the rock'n'roll frontlines often play like pep talks, urging whoever's listening to forget their good-for-nothing exes, secure themselves a beverage or three, and enjoy the party. While Timony bemoans the cooler-than-thou set on ""War Paint"", her lifer status lends a certain knowing air to , a sense that she's been to enough of these little shindigs to know just how to get through them without too many cigarette burns in the carpet. And, sure, the uptick in economy on display throughout the lean, mean  certainly stands in opposition to Timony's labyrinthine back catalog.

25,Azealia Banks,Broke With Expensive Taste,Prospect Park,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Following endless delays, a highly publicized split with Interscope, and a wealth of divisive Twitter feuds, it was starting to seem more and more likely that Azealia Banks’ long-gestating debut would never emerge from the sealed vault at her former label’s headquarters. And yet, seemingly on a whim this past November, the Harlem rapper posted a link to the album, now released through indie imprint Prospect Park. Coming three long years after ""212"" and two after Banks’ strong  mixtape,  spurred expectations that inevitably fell into two camps: those who eagerly anticipated whatever Banks had been working on for so long, and those whose interest had waned after one too many slapdash singles Banks issued in the interim.But the wait was worth it:  is Banks at her most gleefully propulsive. As the album weaves through '90s house samples, AraabMuzik-assisted trap beats, salsa breakdowns, and glassy synth work from UK producer Lone, it’s up to Banks’ springy, infectious flow to keep it all from falling apart, a feat she carries off with extraordinary ease. The grab-bag approach to genre is a huge part of what made  such a thrilling, singular listen in 2014, providing a host of new access points into Banks’ music taste.  may not be perfect, but it affirmed that Banks’ rapid-fire talent behind the mic is not something to be dismissed. —Eric Torres

It's the particular hell of the touring rock band, or of the cat that someone in that band misses a lot. (Cats, in fact, are evoked all over the record, most notably on the title track, a hardcore blowout that made its first appearance as —the joke being that its score is mostly just a single chord jackhammered quadruple-fortissimo.) Part of what they're stuck inside is the lineage of bands for whom guitars are devices of chaos, like their inescapable comparison points Pavement and the Velvet Underground; part of what they're stuck outside of is the ability to mean things without referring to and assessing the past. (What they hear on ""Instant Disassembly"" isn't the ""fine, fine music"" of the Velvets' ""Rock and Roll"", it's ""the last classic rock band's last solid record""). So they focus their considerable wit and formidable sneers on reference and assessment: if ""Ducking & Dodging"" is the hundredth killer rewrite of , ""Vienna II"" is the Fall's  appearing the second time as farce. —Douglas Wolk

Lykke Li Knows.At the start of her career, Li would talk about being a , or how she was  to acknowledge her heart. For her third album, , she drops the coyness, trades bouncy beats for acoustic guitars, and stages gloom as epic theater or classic literature, descended from Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary. At times, there’s a detachment that gives her a cold strength—then, her voice shifts to pleading and penitent, a reminder that for all her melodramatic unapproachability, she’s only human. Like all great romantics, she has the audacity to love without self-consciousness, regardless of the attendant heartbreak. She reminds us to do the same. —Jeremy Gordon

Then they sign to a big label, release the best album of their career, deliver , and suddenly find themselves near the upper echelon of the indie universe. It’s kind of heartwarming. Future Islands’ sound has grown in proportion with their fanbase, and  presents a metamorphosis from dinky, basement-show electro-punk to full-blown, florid new romantic synth-pop, born to be heard thundering from the stages of large concert halls and festivals. It’s uplifting self-help music, defiantly uncool, and proudly vulnerable, with spiritually minded lyrics bellowed by a guy who looks like Jack Black and sounds like Dave Gahan and Nick Cave (with a splash of Cookie Monster). Indeed, Samuel T. Herring has emerged as one of the most dynamic frontmen in rock, a larger-than-life physical presence who specializes in the kind of un-self-conscious, awkward movements we all bust out when we’re alone in our homes. He dances like nobody’s watching, but for Future Islands in 2014, everybody was watching. —Amy Phillips

Eno and Underworld’s Karl Hyde battle against heavily syncopatedand subtly mutating percussion tracks; the songwriting is understated, but not indulgently so: hypnotic, not soporific.

30,Deerhunter,Monomania,4AD,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"On the last few Deerhunter records, grit and gloss have struggled to split the available sonic real estate. For every set of shimmering and uplifting chords, weirdo-equilibrium had to be restored using a blast of feedback or a flood of woozy delay-pedal-washes. With , the Atlanta-based band’s sixth LP and first without longtime bassist Josh Fauver, the grit gets the upper hand. Here, singer/guitarist Bradford Cox appears to have swapped out his cherished Stereolab and Echo & the Bunnymen LPs for the collected works of Royal Trux, playing up his band’s already established yen for gristly garage rock and dabbling in the loose and bluesy vibes of 70s Rolling Stones. But even though nearly every track is pushed into the red,  ranks among Deerhunter’s most subdued efforts. The distortion masks what is otherwise a set of fairly introspective breakup songs, with Cox singing about getting ditched (“Back to the Middle”), obsession (“Monomania”), and some fantasized dominant/submissive relationship dynamics (“Dream Captain”). It's not a record that pleased all the band's fans, particularly those who prefer their epic space-rock turns, but it's a compelling left-field turn that shores up Deerhunter's other big strength: Unpredictability. —Aaron LeitkoDeerhunter: "

Early singles like ""Love Me Like That"" and ""Vacuum Boogie"" playfully bounced between rubbery disco and boogie at a time when his fellow countrymen were making warehouse-shaking dubstep. Even when he embraced bass music, it was garlanded with vintage soul voices and sumptuous strings.So it’s not unexpected that seven years into his career, he’s eschewed easy categorization on his debut album, . Helixed into ’s DNA is everything from primitive circuitry pulses to Alice Coltrane’s divine songs, from Herbie Hancock’s ARP thrusts to late ’60s soul. The album moves between solo exploratory electronics to full-blown ensembles taking flight and makes it all sound of a piece. It’s that rare album that speaks to the current year yet could have emanated from 40 years prior. Outside of time, Floating Points’s closest peers could also be found well beyond the electronic idiom: His spiritually questing music has more in common with jazz players like Kamasi Washington, Joshua Abrams, and Gregory Porter than what turns up at your local club’s DJ sets. In taking a divergent path, Floating Points soared skyward. —Andy Beta

Future stops rapping, which he's only half-doing at this point anyway, and outlines in loopy spoken word what happened after his DJ, Esco, was arrested in Dubai: ""People didn't even understand that my hard drives that I recorded all my music for two years straight was on this…was on this one hard drive that Esco had and he was locked up with it so I had to record new music. That's when I did ."" It's as if he's so dejected by this loss (of music—no mention of the 56 nights Esco spent in prison) that he couldn't pull together a cohesive verse and just had to talk out his heartbreak.

But his rapping is nimble and dreamy, partially because he never seems to fully pronounce anything, even when he hits double time. It’s a strange effect. And it’s a strange record. The production is mostly slow and sad, peppered with alarms, weezy keyboards, hi-hats at the tempo of anxious toe-tapping. On the verse before the interlude on ""Kno the Meaning"", Future says the best thing he ever did was fall out of love. He says it like it’s nothing. What kind of darkness is this guy experiencing? On ""Rotation"", he outlines some of the more money/more problems aspects of his life as a rich person. Sure, shortly after he says with a glint of pride, ""Ask me how it feels to be a millionaire.""

While the resulting shapes are broadly familiar, they’re rendered alien and strange by the sheer closeness of details, like placing your eyes almost against the skin of a lover.Anything can happen in these songs. A boot-knocking country shuffle can suddenly become submerged on a reef of moaning strings, or a gossamer-winged pop song drowned in a multi-tracked rainshower of a thousand little Julia Holters, because she has the commitment to follow through exactingly on each of her smallest and most fragmented impulses, and then to forge them into songs like skyscrapers, their greatness the exact sum of their glittering parts.Like past alchemists Robert Wyatt or Jane Siberry, Holter combines meticulousness and lightheadedness, a studied discipline with a wide-eyed bewilderment. She’s like a scrupulous technician tasked with producing moments of seemingly unselfconscious immediacy. ""Show me now/ Show me your second face,"" she asks on ""Night Song"", but it’s the album itself that offers a parade of second faces, ornately sculpted masks as windows to the soul. —Tim Finney"
29,The Haxan Cloak,Excavation,Tri Angle,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Most of what you’ve heard about , the second album by London producer the Haxan Cloak, is probably true: An instrumental concept record about the slow slide or sudden drop into death, these are 51 rather harrowing minutes, filled with forlorn strings and dismal noise, collapsing rhythms and macabre vocal cuts. The bass is plangent and massive, padding clicking beats and gray layers with the tonal dominance of drone metal. During “Miste”, a character struggles to catch his breath against the string-painted creep of mortality; during “The Mirror Reflecting (Part 2)”, a beat mimics a heartbeat but soon stumbles over itself, ultimately fading against a backdrop of hair-rising oblivion. Without a word,  alternately conjures drowning, suffocation, heart attacks, and sheer senescence—a chronicle of suffering and uncertainty, rendered in exquisite existentialist onomatopoeia. This is Burial, making good on the name, or Demdike Stare, slipping into grimm robes. But the end-to-end thrill of  comes not from Bobby Krlic’s fatalistic fixation.

And yet , her most vulnerable and human record to date, is also her best. Case’s balance of tender and tough has never been more delicate, and her eye for keen observation only grows truer with time: a mother’s frayed nerves finally splitting at a bus stop, a stack of faded calling cards left to gather dust in a shoebox, a puffy-sleeved relic from decades past. Her indelible voice forms the core of every song, whether it’s flecked with harmony or swaddled by blooming horns or standing alone, nearly naked; its clarity can be disarming.

26,James Blake,Overgrown,Republic,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"James Blake emerged in a string of singles and EPs made from alien alloys of singer/songwriter fare, classical music, solemn gospel, pop R&B, and the softest, sultriest strains of dubstep. When it came time for his first LP in 2011, he abandoned the R&B samples that had made him trendy, emphasizing his austere but opulent production style and the indie choirboy side of his musical persona. Those who wished for more “I Never Learnt to Share”-style grandeur, less “Lindesfarne” twee got just what they wanted on second album , where the frilly piano-man is relegated to little corners like “Dim”. Most of the record is given to shadowy, imperious electronic soul, with dubstep lingering in the halftime drums and swimmy sub-basses. The cool subtlety of the music is offset by some of his hottest, most brash vocal performances—take the falsetto-prone singer’s new adventures in vocal fry, like the spine-chilling low-register plunge of the word “constellation” on “I Am Sold”. It's a gesture that lets us know exactly what time it is there: nighttime. While deeply reflective and sad, the music seethes pure sex, and not even RZA musing about the fingertouch of a newborn kid dilutes the vibe. —Brian HoweJames Blake: "
25,Drake,Nothing Was the Same,Cash Money / Young Money Entertainment / Universal Republic,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013," is a feat of maturity. It boasts a stylistically broad array of singles but gleams like a single piece of crystal when consumed in full. Drake’s rapping is at its tightest; he’s chosen his guest features wisely and sparingly. With the help of producer pal Noah Shebib, he's learned to edit himself down to a restrained 13 tracks. The muted beats and themes cascade effortlessly. Which makes it all the more thrilling to catch the little flashes of Drake's diminishing oafishness, the geeky roughness around the edges of such a gorgeously spun and scrupulously chiseled piece of work. ""A few bottles on the table,” he whispers. “A few waters."" Drake is still the only rapper concerned with keeping his friends hydrated while they're turning up, and too loyal to stop them from fucking up the best music videos of the year with their teenage-boy buffoonery. It’s impossible to hear Drake moan, “Peaking, I'm peeeeaking"" without blushing and averting your eyes in shame. He just wants some head in a comfortable bed? . There's the Drake we’d almost forgotten, the guy who charms with his fumbles and who is not quite self-aware enough to realize he can't pull off a line like that yet. It’s our good fortune that he probably never will. —Carrie BattanDrake: "

Every action flowed from his warning shots on ""No Tellin’"": ""Please do not speak to me like I’m that Drake from four years ago/ I’m at a higher place."" If everyone called him soft, the muscles and abs he  said otherwise. The toughness of the album’s opening bars pushed back against accusations that he was just a singer (""When I pull up on a nigga/ Tell that nigga back back/ I’m too good with these words/ Watch a nigga backtrack""). Too calculating? Remember, this million-selling album was scheduled to drop for free.Above all, Drake dripped sauce and self-confidence, so much that even the ghostwriting allegations——from his beef with Meek Mill couldn’t slow him down. His barbed words even clashed with upper management on ""No Tellin’"": ""Envelopes coming in the mail…hoping for a check again, ain’t no tellin'."" The title of the album was widely interpreted as a contract-releasing taunt to Cash Money boss Birdman, but it could have summed up his year: On , the goal is forward motion, and allowing the past to remain rather than endlessly mining previous sorrows.

On ""Figure 8"", she’s an angel whose ""back wings give the hardest slap that you’ve ever seen."" ""Glass & Patron""’s narrator feigns insecurity–""Am I dancing sexy yet?""–before twigs flips the script, singing as a menacing photographer over a dystopic dance-studio beat. Even when vulnerable, on the exquisite ""In Time"", she radiates wisdom. Lyrically, the song maps love’s extremities—heightened states of yearning, idealism, and resentment—and climaxes in a romantic bust-up. But the vocal, navigating a precarious beat, surveys the wreckage from a safe space. The narrator suggests that, having dredged their insecurities for verbal ammo, the couple have emerged stronger. The vision is piercing and true, even if delirium never seems far off. —Jazz Monroe"

It’s one of many dredging processes employed on , a shattering breakup album that tempers its literal account of midlife divorce with deconstructions of love, grief, and selfhood. It’s ultimately the melodrama that makes the album click. Witness her soaring demand for ""emotional respect"" on ""Stonemilker""; her contempt of her partner’s ""joy peak, humor peak, frustration peak"" on ""Lionsong""; her extraordinary claim, in ""Black Lake"", that ""I honored my feelings/ You betrayed your own heart/ Corrupted that organ."" So raw is that song that she later , ""I was really embarrassed ... I can still hardly listen to it."" Having renounced its shame,  becomes a one-woman rhapsody so radically cathartic it is practically avant-garde. —Jazz Monroe"
14,Young Thug,Barter 6,Atlantic / 300 Entertainment,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"When Young Thug announced that he would be swiping his album title from Lil Wayne's  series—a homage that later morphed into a diss—the popular assumption was that he would be following the lead of his primary influence and making  a proper crossover release. It turned out to be just a mixtape, hastily compiled in an effort to preempt the impending leak of 100+ songs from a stolen laptop. If anything,  has more in common with Wayne's less heralded post-Katrina masterwork —a ferocious display of rapping qua rapping by an artist in his prime with zero concern for the marketplace.It's an unexpectedly subtle tape from an artist who is so frequently pegged as a weirdo rapper. Thug's eccentricities are undeniable but they take more nuanced shapes here. He stretches tire screech ad lib into new vocal dimensions and indulges his oft underrated lyrical side through De La Soul-type flits of structure like ""Motor running/ Spent them commas/ Now it's thunder."" And by the album's second half he all but completely abandons the sort of spastic pressure-and-release flows that defined hits like ""Danny Glover"", instead hammering away endlessly at the same rhyme patterns in the service of tragedy. He'll frequently lock into a single rigid flow and stay trapped there for several more bars than he needs to, still escalating the intensity by the sheer rising stress in his voice. This tension isn't fully resolved until the album's final seconds when the beat fades to silence and Thug finally gets a chance to clear his throat. —Andrew Nosnitsky"

Despite all that,  never feels over-thought. Instead, it’s marked by moments of tremendous, startling vulnerability. ""Anecdotes"", the record’s opener, contains what might be the most heartbreaking coda I’ve ever heard sung: ""Nor is there cause for grieving, nor is there cause for carrying on"", Newsom announces, her voice high, calm.  is lousy with these sorts of perfectly drawn endings, like on ""Waltz of the 101st Lightborne"", in which she gives a startlingly clear-eyed summation of love and its disrepair: ""But there was a time/ We were lashed to the prow of a ship you may board, but not steer/ Before ‘You and I’ ceased to mean ‘Now’"". Newsom is often praised for her virtuosity—both as a harpist and as a writer of odd, looping melodies—but here, it’s just as often her lyrics that do the undoing. —Amanda Petrusich"
12,Father John Misty,"I Love You, Honeybear",Bella Union / Sub Pop,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Boredom may be the privilege of people who don’t have to struggle to stay alive, but you can’t blame Josh Tillman for feeling so…. Tillman looks at America and sees a hollowed-out middle class, a generation obsessed with their phones, mass culture used by the bourgeoisie to keep people sated and divided. That’s enough to make anyone cynical, regardless of their comforts.Bearing witness to his pomp and circumstance as he portrays Father John Misty, the one guy who really knows how it is, can be like arguing with the smartest philosophy major in the freshman dorm: Sure, he gets it, but you still want him to get over it. But what grounds Tillman’s sense of superiority is how he believes in the oldest and corniest solution for all the world’s troubles: each other.  is the story of his courtship of his wife, Emma, and his jesterly antics can’t hide the way he’s taken over from the inside-out by his love for her. ""People are boring,"" he sings, ""but you’re something else."" Tillman sings about making spontaneous love in the kitchen, smiling as he walks with Emma, rolling around in the dirtied sheets, and wanting to settle down in spite of his doubts about everything. The music is warm, sensuous, and ambitious, a wino singing like Gram Parsons as he’s backed by an orchestra.Though his cynicism remains, it’s made secondary to something bigger than himself. ""Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity,"" he asks, ""But what I fail to see is what’s that gotta do with you and me?"" There are uncomfortable moments—Tillman turns vitriolic when his wife gets hit on at a bar, and he’s downright demeaning about a kind of woman he hates, even after they’ve gone home together. Still, this lingering combativeness feels honest—an admittance that where there’s love, there’s hate. The clarity of his belief in the former makes  believably and compellingly romantic, filled with sentiment as it avoids sentimentality. It’s one grand joke he’s letting you in on, and if it doesn’t tug on your heartstrings or tickle your funny bone, Tillman has a question: ""Why the long face, jerkoff?"" —Jeremy Gordon

This isn’t exactly a career summary, but it does bring back some of the vapor-trail electronics of earlier OPN efforts while also building out a few of the crackpot concepts of that prior record. On certain tracks those worlds collide. Lopatin isn’t so much interested in malfunctioning circuitry as he is in the primitive ways of machines at the birth of computing. It can be simultaneously thought-provoking, funny, and startling, but it’s not a patchwork of thoughts loosely stitched together; there’s a warped logic to the way transitions happen, from manic machine noise to bubbly bass tones to snippets of deranged chatter.  is an uncannily accurate embodiment of the kind of second guessing your brain indulges in late at night after a long lack of sleep, where you need to loop back on things just to be sure they actually happened. —Nick Neyland

23,DJ Rashad,Double Cup,Hyperdub,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"DJ Rashad focuses on a regional scene—Chicago footwork—with its own way of dancing, moving, and emphasizing rhythmic structure, and then sees what else he can weave into its DNA: bounce rap (“Pass That Shit”), jungle (“I'm Too Hi”), house (“Leavin'”), hardcore techno (“Acid Bit”), and R&B (“Only One”). That he molds these styles to fit some brilliant drum programming is the key to his success; all you have to do is isolate the snares and follow their unpredictable, but eminently danceable paths to get an idea of just how snatch-your-breath these beats are at the core. And the melodies he strings together to wash over them—piano and synthesizer chords that jump from hover to shudder; cut-up mood-altering vocals from Tupac in mode (“I Don't Give a Fuck”) or peak-disco First Choice reconfigured by Shep Pettibone for the dawn of house (“Every Day of My Life”)—coats a gleaming veneer of recognizable, personality-driven order over a huge engine of what seems like chaos. But it's chaos you can move to, once you figure out how. —Nate Patrin

Eavesdropping on entwined couples through paper thin walls? Sitting in the car, sifting through stems and seeds? Waking up next to somebody who'll be sleeping through the morning? You've been there; you've done that. Crutchfield has a way of making the early-20-something tableaus of —her second LP as Waxahatchee—feel impossibly (and sometimes uncomfortably) real. The people of  drink too much, fight too easily, feel too deeply, make promises too big to keep. With just a few words, Crutchfield places these characters among all-too-recognizable scenery: hollow bedrooms, closets clogged with empty bottles, riverside consolations in pickup flatbeds.  was recorded quickly, at her parents' place in Alabama, an urgent-sounding record about people who aren't getting where they want as fast as they'd hoped.

He remains a shadowy figure even on his boldest album, communicating in breathy whispers or casual background chatter and ceding much of his ground to his guests. Call it shyness or humility or grace, or just call it savvy:  is proof that Hynes is more effective working in a collage of subtle shades than with force. His friends have never sounded as slick as they do in his calm, self-assured company—Samantha Urbani achieves new heights of sultriness; Dirty Projectors’ Dave Longstreth is suddenly a soulful presence; rapper Despot harnesses the throwback coolness of a Beastie Boy. Let Hynes put his fingerprints on your work and together you’ll turn to gold. —Carrie Battan

11,Oneohtrix Point Never,Garden of Delete,Warp,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Being a teenager is complicated.

It’s Lopatin's heaviest album so far, but also his most fragile. At times, you’ll find yourself wanting to figure out how to dance to its weirdo rhythms. Or you’ll think of a Nine Inch Nails cassette melting in the sun. Mashing together power ballads and warped takes on pop hits with grinding noise, techno, melancholic drone, and blunted hiss,  is romantic, frantic, chilly, jubilant, ghostly, and sometimes sad. There are references to troubled kids and kids just saying the dumb and brilliant stuff kids say: ""I'm just going to start off by doing some stupid stuff because that’s what I do. It's in me, my blood,"" one brags in “Mutant Standard"".  does an incredible job of evoking the gorgeous, thrilling mess we needed to get through to finally enter adulthood, except you can tell it’s been painstakingly pieced together, nothing left to chance.Before the record was released, Lopatin offered up a  cosmology, one that featured an invented band, Kaoss Edge, and a teenage alien collaborator/troll with bad skin named Ezra. You can go to real blogs and Twitter accounts and other pages run by these entities, and they often interact with Lopatin’s online. Of course, you can safely assume Ezra is part Lopatin——but the bigger idea is that we all were at some point. —Brandon Stosuy

10,Kamasi Washington,The Epic,Brainfeeder,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"For a minute there Kamasi Washington was The Guy Who Played Saxophone and Created the Jazz Arrangements on the Kendrick Record, but it didn’t take long for his astonishing album  to develop a life of its own. Nothing about its success makes sense: a triple album with almost three hours of music, featuring a 10-piece jazz band, often augmented with a string section and a full choir, released on Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder imprint? In an era when we supposedly measure the direction of our consciousness by counting clicks, it didn’t add up. But  turned out to serve a need many people didn’t know they had.Here’s one possible explanation: With reissue culture and the vinyl revival in overdrive, people are rediscovering jazz created when the music was a more significant part of the cultural conversation. The work of John Coltrane, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago offered an avant-garde that was formally daring, grounded in the history of American music, and, for many of these musicians, deeply political and connected to the African-American struggle for equality.  taps into this spirit but forgoes the fiery and explosive jazz of the late '60s for the period just after, when jazz, pop-soul, and R&B came together to find common ground after the tumult of the previous decade. Free jazz players incorporated , and song-oriented superstars were thinking about how their . has plenty of straightforward jazz and solo trading, but its most striking elements are when genres clash in unpredictable ways—songs that sound like they floated in from a Broadway musical (""Henrietta Our Hero""), impossibly grand massed vocals and strings that could soundtrack the next  reboot (""Askim""), brilliantly textured mood pieces evocative of Miles Davis’ mid-'60s quintet (""Seven Prayers""). It’s a lifetime of creative thought packed into one release, and the grand scope and sweep of the thing was an act of generosity in itself. —Mark Richardson

9,Courtney Barnett,"Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit",Mom & Pop / Marathon Artists / Milk!,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"Courtney Barnett's debut album has the kind of weary worldview usually associated with an artist's later efforts. She scares off expectations by roaring, ""Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you"" because she knows she's ""just a reflection of what you really wanna see."" And who really knows what they want? Not Barnett.  portrays a young woman struggling with how to be for other people when she's not sure how to be for herself. The 28-year-old Australian barely ventured a viewpoint in her songs without retracting it a line or two later. ""What do I know anyhow? … Guess everybody's got their different point of view."" is full of wry epics spun from insignificant seeds, whether house-hunting, buying fruit, or sleepless nights spent staring at the ceiling. In a way, Barnett's tangent-prone songwriting style reinforces her point about reflections:  and any angle is possible. (Though good luck writing it as well as she can.) Spotting a newspaper story about dredging when you're in an existentially bad mood can lead to morbid contemplations about the point of it all, sure. But from her counter-arguments and shrugs, a subtle, certain songwriter emerges. Barnett tries out a lot of different modes on : laconic country-tinged ballads, Nirvana ragers, and Lemonheads-y choogle. She sticks to one voice though. Literally a monotone, but a funny one, where roadkill is a ""possum Jackson Pollock"". It's a marvel of intensity and feeling that quietly questions where we find value, and its price. —Laura Snapes

But Miguel is both a beefier vocalist and a more imaginative producer, and “Waves” is one of the album’s highlights. His charisma, a sheer omnivorous force of personality, turns whatever he touches into into jams. ""Hollywood Dreams"" treads approximately zero new ground, but Miguel tears into California corruption like he’s annexing it all for himself."
7,D'Angelo / The Vanguard,Black Messiah,RCA,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"As a song called ""1000 Deaths"" chugs to life on D'Angelo's first album in 14 years, the voice of Black Panther Fred Hampton is heard decrying the ""megalomaniac"" powers that be who stand in the way of peace for blacks and whites alike. ""We've got to fight them,"" the controversial civil-rights leader concludes, ""to make them understand what peace means."" At age 21, Hampton was shot and killed in a police raid on a Black Panther base on Chicago's West Side in December, 1969; though the authorities claimed that they were justified in the incident, a subsequent federal investigation found that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, while nearly 100 were let off by the cops. Forty-five years later, and just eight miles south of Hampton's slaying, an unarmed 17-year-old named Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by a single police officer—the latest atrocity involving America's lethal refusal of black being.The intractability of this refusal is drawn out within the layers of , through the scarred guitars, the murky vocal harmonies, the grooves that never fully settle. It's a sad testament to an enduring struggle D'Angelo himself describes as a ""charade""—though the album's grainy black-and-white cover looks like something from Hampton's heyday, it was actually taken during Brooklyn's Afropunk Festival in 2014. But for all of its somber complexities,  still manages to cling to its title's sense of rejuvenation. It's not all hopeless. A self-described optimist, D'Angelo also sings of sex, love, nostalgia, and faith across the record, which breathes with enough analog warmth to convert the staunchest vinyl skeptic. ""Another Life"", the album's finale, is a tribute to the smoothness of Philly Soul, a style that soundtracked America's burgeoning black middle class in the mid-'70s. The song fantasizes of a forever romance as heavenly piano chords and D'Angelo's pure falsetto slide it into the slow jam canon. And yet, at its core, the track feels like a mirage. It's no coincidence that 's most luscious moment is also the one that looks beyond our own world. —Ryan Dombal"

We get lost in screens, sex, stories, drugs, dreams, work, and music to forget the fact that, one day, the planet will spin without us; if there is noise, then there is not silence. Over the last 15 years, Sufjan Stevens has employed a particular sort of overflowing aesthetic maximalism to stave off that empty feeling. His songs are often marked by melancholy, but then strings, horns, blips, and banjo enter, and we’re swept away, saved from the bottomless pit below. On , though, he forces himself—and his listeners—to face the brink with a stripped sound. The album’s first song is called ""Death With Dignity"" and its opening lines are delivered in a hush: ""Spirit of my silence I can hear you/ But I’m afraid to be near you"".Carrie is the troubled mother Stevens hardly knew, who died in 2012; Lowell is the loving step-father who to this day helps run Stevens’ independent record label. They seem to represent the entirety of this songwriter’s psyche: the interminable longing for and eventual loss of the woman who gave him life as well as the tremendous gratitude for and admiration of a man to whom he has no blood ties. While  is certainly not a party record, it’s not a pity party record either—it never devolves into mere mope for mope’s sake. Even if Stevens is making less noise than usual, these 11 elegies fill up a grand space. In the end, there’s comfort in knowing that this album will outlive us all. —Ryan Dombal"

Too bad, because he's apparently been listening to a lot of Air and DeBarge, on headphones, in his bedroom, with his axe tucked away in its case. He's gone past the title of 2012's  to total desolation on , whose every lyric makes the absence of anyone else in his studio evident. Even when he's talking to someone else, it's someone who's not in his life any more. (The chorus of ""'Cause I'm a Man"" pretends to be defensive bluster, but its context makes it clear that it's an outburst of shame addressed to an empty space.)There's still a bit of Parker's elegant guitar here, but he's mostly rerouted his perfectionistic craftsmanship to synthesizer tones and drum programming. If you want the old Tame Impala back, that's not about to happen: ""Maybe fake's what I like,"" he murmurs on ""New Person, Same Old Mistakes"". The weightless, drifty sounds in the foreground of  conceal the jagged edges of lyrics whose core topics are failed romance and emotional paralysis.

The ex-shooter eulogizes the corpses, the snitches, and those condemned in the penitentiary—tracing his own escape route to sober celebrations on a mezzanine in Paris, lamenting those who never made it out. He’s not a conscious rapper, he’s a conscience rapper—attempting to make it to heaven in spite of those he may or may not have helped to hell. He says more in a bar than most say in an album (""I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari."") No one has done contrition like this since Clipse. It’s all here: semi-automatic blasts and seagull sounds, Christ juxtaposed with crip walking, suntanned assassins trapped in surf-adjacent slums. He riffs on racial profiling, drug addiction, educational failures, police brutality, and white folks chanting ""nigga"" at concerts. He’s the halfway point between Ice Cube and Ian Curtis. Listen once more to the doomed pop of ""Summertime"", his voice practically disintegrating as he repeats, ""this could be forever, baby.""

It has two distinct personalities: the dark, fighter-stance synth-pop of songs like ""Kill V. Maim"" and the Janelle Monáe-featuring club-ready banger ""Venus Fly"", or lighter, bubblegum jams like ""California"" and ""Belly of the Beat"". Whether over minimalist piano ballads or macho guitar rock, Boucher faces those who’ve doubted her, tackling fame-hungry vampires, platonic heartbreakers, privileged men, and more. She's taking all the heat and intensity that comes along with an Internet-fueled spotlight and radiating that energy outward, blinding detractors and putting on an epic light show for everyone else. —Hazel Cills"

Like anyone who spends the majority of her working life on the road, Van Etten has created coping mechanisms for her ""real"" life. That comes across in the studio in-jokes behind closing track ""Every Time the Sun Comes Up"" and the easy R&B grooves that make ""Our Love"" and ""Taking Chances"" two of her strongest songs to date. Van Etten’s signature earnestness isn’t exactly in short supply, either; ""Your Love Is Killing Me"" is the most eloquently written song about ""crying uncle"" in a relationship. ""Afraid of Nothing"" possesses the fearlessness of someone who’s seen the world precisely because she pours her heart out; after you do that, what’s so scary about an uncomfortable phone call to the person who knows you best? ""A love letter to the road"" is a common description for art, but what Sharon Van Etten made is an ode to realizing that we’re never done moving forward. —Jillian Mapes

2,Jamie xx,In Colour,Young Turks,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"The Persuasions' ""Good Times"" is one of those songs where the good times are always just about to come. ""I can’t afford the fancy dancing places/ But as long as you have faith in me/ We’ll have ourselves a grand time"", the a cappella group proclaims on its 1972 single, locked in the future tense. Jamie xx sampled a line from the song for ’s dancehall-tinged song of the same name, but he tellingly lets the original track play in full during live performances. The point is obvious when the sampled section hits: This was clearly the right selection. is an album full of perfect decisions like this. The London producer honed the knack for subtleties that he first flashed in his 2011 solo one-off ""Far Nearer"" and on Gil Scott-Heron’s remix album , establishing himself as a solo force in his own right. The album tread broader stylistic territory than the hushed guitar minimalism of his main group the xx, from Popcaan and Young Thug’s gleeful profanity on ""Good Times,"" to the Aphex Twin ambient lullaby ""The Rest Is Noise,"" to the fractured vocal samples of ""Sleep Sound,"" which recalls the blissful techno shimmer of the Field. The wistful thread tying this all together was that unbridgeable distance between past and present: You heard it in the soaring synth melodies and disembodied rave chatter of the opener, ""Gosh"". But it’s ""Loud Places"", where Jamie xx takes fellow xx-er Romy Madley Croft’s vocals to one of those ""fancy dancing places"" in search of ""someone to be quiet with, who will take me home,"" where the good times are closest at hand: ""I feel music in your eyes/ I have never reached such heights.""  distills that feeling. —Marc Hogan"
1,Kendrick Lamar,To Pimp a Butterfly,Interscope / Aftermath / Top Dawg,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2015,"At this point, it should be no surprise that Kendrick Lamar's  is the Album of the Year on numerous lists, including this one. Upon its release, it was universally lauded. It was only March, but the writing was on the White House walls:  was an opus, a statement, a feat. It felt weighty, labored, accomplished. One hour and 20 minutes of big ideas handled with complexity, it was a dextrous addition to the canon of art expressing disenchantment with fame and success. It launched a thousand , and forced critics to think deeply about music—to the point that it was still generating , as late as last month, eight months after its release. Commercially speaking, it set , meaning that it was being listened to as fervently as it was being debated.It's also . ""Blackness"" is a concept that remains fluid and intangible, but so solid that one can feel it when it’s present. And it was all over . From the opening notes (a sample of Boris Gardiner's ) to the closing—a fabricated conversation with Tupac Shakur—the album is packed with Blackness. Kendrick may not have given the public much advance warning for ’s rich sound—the luxe spillover of stripped funk and jazz grooving of Terrace Martin, Kamasi Washington, Flying Lotus, Thundercat, and many others—but he made his thematic intentions abundantly clear with the pre-release singles. The first, ""i"", with its Isley Brothers sample and message of self-love, was initially overlooked for its subversion; while Black folk were telling the world that #BlackLivesMatter, Kendrick turned the message inwards: ""I love myself."" It was the amendment to  that veered uncomfortably close to . (""What happened to [Michael Brown] should've never happened. Never,"" he told the magazine. ""But when we don't have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us? It starts from within. Don't start with just a rally, don't start from looting—it starts from within."")At a moment when his peers remained fixated on finding worth and esteem from the world and things around them—the power of , the trappings of , the numbing of , the escape of —Kendrick emerged as a grounded Black hippie. He was enthralled with all of the same things as other rappers, but not beholden to them. He escaped into pussy on ""These Walls"" but philosophized as he stroked: ""Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment/ Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension/ Me? I’m just a tenant."" When he got drunk on ""u"", he turned to self-loathing: ""Mood swings is frequent, nigga/ I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga."" When he gassed up his luxury vehicle on , ""How Much a Dollar Cost"", he encountered God in the form of a beggar.None of these things are explicitly Black, but the lens through which they were filtered was undoubtedly so. From its vernacular to its point of view,  was about dealing with the survivor's remorse of escaping the poverty of Black America, while also relating to those still there. On ""Institutionalized"", when he took one of his hood friends to the BET Awards, he noted: ""You lookin' at artistses like they harvestses/ So many Rolies around you and you want all of ’em/ Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry.""Nowhere is Blackness more front and center than on the album’s second single, ""The Blacker the Berry"". It was the song that most clearly announced Kendrick's lack of fucks about the comfort of his white audience. Perhaps it was a retort to his previous Grammy snubs; maybe it was a reaction to seeing ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"", his anti-drunk song, turned into a pro-drunk song in the mouths of bros. Whatever his reasoning, ""The Blacker the Berry"" provided white people with no entry into the song: There is hardly anything on the song for  unless she was going to deal with psychic turmoil of mouthing ""My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide/ You hate me don't you?/ You hate my people—your plan is to terminate my culture/ You're fuckin' evil, I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey."" He labeled the song as the ""emancipation of a real nigga"" and, even in a society where whites regularly rub ears with the n-word, it was abrasive and unsettling.All of this Blackness is important. Important because sometimes white people need to take a metaphorical seat—to sit down, shut up, and listen to conversations in which they are a cultural object, not the center. This is not an easy task. White people have been way too comfortable for way too long in this country, in this world. Way too comfortable with the way they choose to see reality solely through their own gaze, way too comfortable with their sense of entitlement over the planet and its resources, way too comfortable with their appropriation of culture in ways large and small, way too comfortable with the stories they tell, the lies passed off as the history of mankind. Way too comfortable with the things they pick up, way too careless with the way they put them down. But Kendrick was willing to discomfort the comfortable. He took all of the acclaim he had received as a critical darling from his major label debut—the rightfully extolled —and doubled down on his Blackness, not for the entertainment of white people, but in near-total disregard for their experience of his conversation. He was Miles Davis playing with his back to the crowd, and in that sense, it's a miracle that this record has found the audiences that it has found.It's an album by the greatest rapper of his generation, where his rap skills are perhaps the least noteworthy talking point. An album so dense with ideas that it made the novelistic turns of his debut—a thoughtful and textured, gang culture-adjacent coming-of-age story—seem quaint and straightforward by comparison. It's an album that is on this list not only because of its merits, but because it's presumably why so many albums are not here, this year—it's not a stretch to reason that  had something to do with why Kanye West and Drake didn't release proper studio albums in 2015. It's an album with such gravitas that the runaway success of Adele's  seems inconsequential. It's not just the album of the year; it's the voice of a moment in time. —kris ex"
18,Arca,Xen,Mute,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"If we had to give it a name, 2014 was the Year of the Body. How fitting that in a moment of digital saturation, we now turn our attention to the physical world, particularly the flesh we find ourselves living inside. Arca's album  comes at these questions from a more abstracted place; these instrumentals may not speak, but they certainly feel like music about boundaries and space, the instability of borders, the impossibility of locating the ""normal,"" the constant desire for change and the nagging sense of loss that always accompanies it. It conveys all this by treating every unit of music as something to be altered. But  remains inviting even with all its experimentation—the album initially sounds ""off"" in a way that makes you want to listen closer rather than turn away, until you hear music that's alive with possibility. Here, the rules of music are always in the background, but they're kept in the frame to show us the beauty that can happen when they're broken. —Mark Richardson

17,Flying Lotus,You're Dead!,Warp,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Rarely are a concept album’s objectives stated so cleanly as those of Flying Lotus’  Right from the foreboding drone that launches this terrifying spirit journey, it’s apparent the album title is a briefing. You’re dead. What’s next? Steve Ellison’s fifth opus imagines a trek from frightened denial to acceptance not unlike Argentinian writer/director Gaspar Noé’s offbeat , where a murdered man’s essence floats around the scene of the crime searching for the strength to let go. ’s early race from drone through frenetic bop, fusion, and hip-hop attempts to dramatize the jarring disorientation of a soul shaken loose from its body and, later, the spacious succession of airy grooves leading the way to the final cut ""The Protest"" feels like a progression toward closure. Ellison sees a freedom in death that the living often don’t: The school children dancing at their own funeral in the gutting clip for the Kendrick Lamar-assisted ""Never Catch Me"" are no longer bound by mortal constructs like pain and sorrow—they run clear out of the door into the evening sky. —Craig Jenkins

16,St. Vincent,St. Vincent,Loma Vista,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"The  over St. Vincent’s  performance back in May had less to do with the quality of her songs than with the demeanor of her performance. Here was A.) a woman B.) wailing on a guitar C.) without resorting to those constipated grimaces that let you know the player is really feeling it, man. Instead, Annie Clark stood nearly stock still on that stage, gesturing in a coded sign language and climactically baby-stepping up and down the stage; she churned out those showily compact riffs while wearing a stoical countenance that hinted at supreme confidence and self-possession. She tore through ""Birth in Reverse"" and ""Digital Witness"" as though she were inventing a new language of rock performance.This particular mission earned her self-titled fourth album such pejoratives as ""pretentious,"" ""cerebral,"" and ""cold,"" which Clark has the audacity to embrace rather than counter.  is a gloriously eccentric album, one that shows off her formidable facility with riffs that turn themselves inside out. If you can get on her wavelength—which isn’t that difficult—this is also a very funny album, as Clark the songwriter makes Big Statements as Big Punchlines. She snorts pieces of the Berlin Wall with a friend and prefers your love to Jesus. An ordinary day in America involves taking out the garbage and masturbating: ""I’m still holding for the laugh."" It may not be her wildest album (that’s still ), but  is certainly the one that is most Annie Clark: giving full rein to all her eccentricities and chuckling to herself at the thought of a popular audience. —Stephen M.

15,Angel Olsen,Burn Your Fire for No Witness,Jagjaguwar,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"It is hard to imagine Angel Olsen posting on Twitter and not feeling a bit ridiculous. The Midwestern folk singer has spent the better part of her 20s making art dedicated to the notion that solitude is necessary for growth and survival. —an aphoristic title worth inking to one's skin, if ever there was one—is Olsen's masterwork, taking the pained beauty of her raw 2012 debut  and stretching the scope of her sound. You'll hear echoes of Leonard Cohen's dim-lit hypnosis on ""White Fire"", and the aching ghosts of an old-souled country jukebox in her ecstatic warble, but listen closely and you will learn from Olsen in a way that feels newly classic. Each line is immaculately written. ""I feel so much at once that I could scream/ I wish I had the voice of everything,"" she emotes wildly on the sublime ""Stars"", and often it seems that she does.Individualism as a virtue is not hard to detect. 's arc pings from strength in self-reliance, Zen-like therapy, and laughable loneliness to more complex vulnerabilities: forgotten dreams, grave rejection, the impossibility of connecting with a person who is right next to you. The trope of ""sadness"" has loomed in culture this year, but not always with the dignity, wisdom, and light that is apparent in Olsen's music. The most piercing moments on  are born in our racing minds when we're alone with our thoughts, the toll of love that is only imagined, the madness of unspoken obsession: ""Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more,"" ""I wish it were the same as it is in my mind,"" ""Thought I felt your heartbeat/ It was just my counting."" Listening to this record, stitching her words into the fabric of my life, I've felt time and again that Angel Olsen is decoding my soul, articulating with grace all these feelings that seem completely ineffable.

A bunch of native New Jersey-ites who now mostly shack in Brooklyn, Real Estate have polished their once fuzzy sound into clean, well-detailed structures that sound more ""sprawl"" than ""suburban,"" and trade stoner-friendly impressions for more pointed confessions. Lead single ""Talking Backwards"" sounds so obviously like a beatific love song, it’s easy to overlook that it’s actually an anxiety-riddled yelp of frustration. comes from the viewpoint of someone who once spent long afternoons lying around staring at the ceiling but doesn’t really do that anymore, and who maybe knows he never will again. (Courtney and his wife had their first child this year.) More than ever, Courtney’s chord progressions worry at their own moments of sweetness like you might prod at a toothache. ""Crime"" aches with the disquiet that makes you ""toss and turn all night,"" while Matt Mondanile’s plangent guitar lines vibrate with impossible clarity against the dissonant murk of ""The Bend"". Feeling grown-up may seem like an extraneous milestone these days (especially if you’re a twentysomething in a band), but the future still gets smaller and creeps closer, and eventually it starts to look more and more like something you already know. Welcome to the eternal melancholy of adulthood. —Abby Garnett

13,Spoon,They Want My Soul,Loma Vista,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"For the better part of the last two decades, Britt Daniel has established partial residence for Spoon in a parallel universe very close to our own. If not quite  then it’s about as close as American indie rock gets to it. Spoon often sounds like other bands—as revealed , that’s part of their point—but there’s always something a bit different, a bit unsettling. In 2010 Daniel finally gave a name to the emotional and sonic wormhole he’s long located: . That’s the space-time twist that holds ""The times that we met/ Before we met,"" those wobbly, resonant left-handed piano chords and the screams that cut off mid-word. The Mystery Zone is where ghosts linger, where Everything Hits at Once, and what freezes the ""walking through the door"" climax of ""Metal Detektor"".On the band’s eighth album , we first enter the Mystery Zone on ""Inside Out"". After being transported by a sustained, echo-laden organ note that accompanies us to the other side, Daniel tells us what he sees and feels, not unlike Rod Serling introducing a ""Twilight Zone"" episode: ""Time's gone inside out/ Time gets distorted with/ This intense gravity."" Now that James Murphy’s retired, Daniel is indie rock’s preeminent sensitive sound-synthesist, and of course ""Inside Out"" is about trying to understand the laws of attraction: ""There’s intense gravity in you/ I’m just your satellite,"" he mewls, while trippily chewing scenery with far-off echoes, synth washes, and, yes, harp glissandos. In a more conventional setting, Side B rocker ""Let Me Be Mine"" takes us to the Mystery Zone via his long-held fascination with emotional memory. Daniel begs someone to ""auction off what you love/ It will come back sometime."" On the sleek punk closer ""New York Kiss"", a dramatic liplock is ""just another place/ a place that your memory owns.""But why soul? One way to think of the term in the rock realm is as code for ""authenticity,"" and such signifiers are all over the album—""Rent I Pay"" and the title track are both fierce, swag-laden diatribes against incorporation into The Machine. But Daniel’s always been interested in the Mystery Zone idea of soul, too—what the Ancient Greeks called our post-mortem ""shade in the underworld."" When Daniel sings ""time keeps on going when/ we got nothing else to give,"" he's reminding us of exactly this.While countless bands wander around in , repurposing what made them successful without any memory of how or why they got there, Spoon have long turned their success inside out. Daniel and Jim Eno’s ultra-rare combination of inventiveness and consistency situated the band in the ""yawn, another great album from these guy""” status way back on 2005’s . In the decade hence, epitomized on , they simply make Spoon Albums that still manage to unsettle our expectations about how indie rock music should sound. Maybe this is Spoon’s greatest trick: the only band to make listeners wonder if they’re the ones in the Mystery Zone, after all. —Eric Harvey

12,Mac DeMarco,Salad Days,Captured Tracks,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"""You're no better off living your life than dreaming at night,"" Mac DeMarco deadpans on ""Brother"". For a guy you just know still laughs at poop jokes, he really sells the existential despair in a way few may have expected when DeMarco emerged with a half-baked project called Makeout Videotape. There’s always been a slight divide between Mac’s goofball persona and his sweet and salty songs, but  may very well become known as his big shift. Not only has the production advanced beyond anything that could reasonably be called lo-fi, DeMarco’s third solo album sees him transitioning from semi-nonsensical tracks about cigarette brands to far more personal writing. By opening up, he’s moved beyond a mere aesthetic and a big personality, two qualities that are crucial to breaking through in music these days. DeMarco’s asked to be taken seriously in a way that strives beyond, ""Hey, this guy’s like an unwashed Harry Nilsson."" Looks like he’s outgrown his slacker title. —Jillian Mapes

11,Perfume Genius,Too Bright,Matador,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"On the first two Perfume Genius records, Mike Hadreas quietly flirted with greatness, usually in the guise of piano-driven songs operating on a level so desperately intimate that you felt as if you were being let in on some sort of beautiful, albeit harrowing, secret. On  Hadreas all but destroys any lingering perceptions of weakness or frailty with a record that is, among other things, a kind of treatise on gay panic and the horrors of the body. The album’s centerpiece—the much-heralded ""Queen""—is the record’s undisputed banger (""No family is safe when I sashay,"" he triumphantly declares), but  shines brightest in it’s weirder moments. ""Fool"" flirts with finger-snapping doo wop, while ""My Body"", with it’s whispery ""I wear my body like a rotted peach"" line, is the most visceral and haunting. Elsewhere the record vacillates between psyched-out, blippy electronica (""Grid"", ""Longpig"") and the kind of staid piano ballads (""No Good"", ""Don’t Let Them In"") that have previously been Hadreas’ stock in trade. Ultimately, it’s an album of extremes, told in the voice of someone righteously coming into their own. Listening to previous Perfume Genius albums often felt like something akin to eavesdropping, but on  Hadreas has command of the audience. ""I don't need your love... I don't need you to understand/ I need you to listen,"" he sings on ""All Along"". It’s a line that nicely sums up ’s . Without even trying, Hadreas simultaneously implodes and illuminates gay stereotypes while articulating the feelings a lot of us queer folks didn’t even realize we had been dying to express. The record doesn’t just demand that you stop and listen; it basically implores you to bow the fuck down. —T. Cole Rachel"
20,Jai Paul,Jai Paul,self-released,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"As of this writing, 673 people have signed  imploring Jai Paul's label, XL Recordings, to release his debut album. ""The 'leak' was seriously the best album of this year,"" insists the petitioner, referring to 16 demos that  on Bandcamp in April only to be  and denounced by both Paul and XL amidst rumors of a stolen laptop. Though the notoriously painstaking London artist—who works with his bassist and brother Anup—has only released two singles over the course of the last two and a half years, the global breadth of the petition’s signees suggests a wide reach, including fans in France, Korea, Colombia, and New Jersey. This cosmopolitan base matches the music that makes up this not-album, from its samples of both traditional Indian music to snatches of ""Gossip Girl"" dialogue, from its Princely guitar solos to all those half-drunk beats that wear their Dilla love with pride. Unfortunately, even if the petition hits 10,000 signatures, it probably won't change much. Indeed, by all accounts, XL would like to see a proper Jai Paul album most.Even considering the surrounding controversy, these tracks give us insight into an artist who doesn't seem like a machiavellian internet hype-master as much as a doubter, a tinkerer, an idealist. In , from 2011, he said, ""Music to me was just a hobby and, in a way, I didn't care about showing it to anyone."" And that internal struggle—so elusive in our  social media world—plays out in these songs, where he sings, perhaps prophetically, ""In the company of thieves/ Will I stay or will I leave?/ Will they steal away my life?/ Will I go down without my fight?/ I might."" Paradoxically, Paul's apparent ambivalence toward a music industry that's desperate to support him has only stirred the fervor of those willing to drop £7 on a shady looking Bandcamp page. When he's ready, we will be, too; if he's not, at least we've got something. —Ryan Dombal

19,Earl Sweatshirt,Doris,Columbia / Tan Cressida,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"When Earl raps, he gazes far off into the distance, so cosmically bored is he by our interest.  at god knows what hour, slumped in front of a fluorescent-lit table: This freestyle is an industry rite of passage, and yet this one is different, precisely because is there, and everyone, in that moment, exists to please him. Sway plays beat after beat; Earl, with the contemptuous purity of a teenager, waves each one away.  ""What would you prefer?"" Sway asks courteously, his industry-vet eyes narrowing with the effort of getting inside Earl's head. When he drops ""Drop It Like It's Hot (Remix)"", a grin cracks Earl's face; his head bops goofily. The physical relief that washes over Sway's body, as he leans back, is palpable. This is the relationship Earl has to the world: We want, more than anything, to hear him rap. We will stand and wait expectantly for minutes, . Frankly, it's awkward, maybe even a little pathetic. Being a functioning teenager, he doesn't exactly relish handing expectant adults what they're waiting for, and thus the first voice we hear on  belongs, hilariously, to Frank Ocean's cousin.This ambivalence is the dance of , the story of Earl Sweatshirt: How do you do what you want when strangers seem to want it even more badly than you do? ""Don't nobody care about how you feel,"" Vince Staples teases on the intro to ""Burgundy"". ""We want raps."" Sooner or later, he's going to have to give up the goods. So he sighs, leans in, opens his mouth. The second he does, our anticipation justifies itself. Quite simply, there hasn't been a more viscerally enjoyable and economical rapper working in years. Earl's POV leaps from the front seat of a car into the sky in a single line (""Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to""); family communications break down into a series of sound effects (""Mama often was offering peace offerings/ Think, wheeze, cough, scoff, and then he's off again""); Earl sprouts a ballooning gut and morphs into a fattened hedonist (You know me, drugs out front the telly/ I'm couch-drunk, ready to fuck/ Count 'fetti and bucks/ Count loud as I slap loud cross the belly""). Try wrestling free of the line ""hard as armed services/ y'all might'a heard of him"" once he utters it. But Earl's heart is in here, too—his father, his mother; that fabled camp for troubled teens, being outed by Complex; girls, fame, puppy love, being true to yourself. ""Breaking news that's less important when the Lakers lose/ There's lead in that baby food,"" he deadpans on ""Hive"". He can tell you are a little dumb, maybe. But he'll oblige, eventually. He even assented to Sway at last, unleashing a verse so devastating that Sway nearly doubled over when it was finished. Earl's verdict? ""That was butt."" —Jayson Greene"
18,Janelle Monáe,The Electric Lady,Bad Boy,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Early on, Janelle Monáe rarely exhibited doubt or vulnerability, not only because she is a bona fide Icon, but also because there has always been another, important correlative to her vibrant self-expression: like any science fiction author, she uses her medium to explore deeply rooted social ills and present an alternative vision of how the revolution might look. Her first EP and LP, and , were vast in scope, and the futuristic dystopian epic they told—that of Cindi Maywether, a cyborg fugitive hunted for the crime of falling in love with a human—was an entertaining but tightly packed narrative. With , the masterful, guest-packed double album she's called a prequel to , Monáe hit her stride. The record is still fearless and luxurious, but now it's accessible, too; songs like ""Dance Apocalyptic"" and Miguel duet ""Primetime"" still resonate without metaphorical context, but the narrative is there if you want it. The powers of ""Q.U.E.E.N."" (""Are we a lost generation of our people?/ Add us to equations but they'll never make us equal"") and ""Ghetto Woman"" (a paean to her mother's uphill battle) are self-evident. Nearly every track pulls its own weight, both individually and in the context of a larger work about inequality and spiritual rebellion. Her isn't a robot, she's an evolved life form. That distinction turned a highly sophisticated, empirically likable work into an organic classic—one that lets people in. —Devon Maloney

When so many rock bands—you know, those things with guitars and drums and hooks you can remember—can seem hopelessly self-defeating, shamed, bored, or worse, Haim make no apologies. They're excited about their own songs enough to look like  while playing them. This enthusiasm is contagious, and it's why these three sisters from L.A.'s San Fernando Valley are responsible for the most appealing pop-rock record since . chronicles the mistakes, triumphs, and confusions our hearts go through as we navigate our 20s, with Este, 27, Danielle, 24, and Alana, 22, bridging the gap between young-adult and adult-adult. Their harmonies and vacuum-packed arrangements put forth a unified front as they try to escape dependency on ""Let Me Go"" (replete with a wriggling guitar solo) or snub-out some lying son of a bitch on ""My Song 5"" as a snap beat gives their middle fingers some extra swagger. The hot emotions are tempered with contemplation, vulnerability; ""Go Slow"" simmers with an ache reminiscent of Kate Bush—another performer who's never been afraid to show her feelings on her face. Meanwhile, the shaggy ""Honey & I"" gloriously splits the difference between those twentysomething Sundays when all you want to do is sleep and the Fridays when you can't close your eyes. ""Love wasn't what I thought it once was,"" sings Danielle, looking past teen dreams with her head high, ""I'm not afraid no more.""

That in and of itself would be a feat on this remarkable run, spanning from his last album as Smog, 2005’s , and reaching to what might be an apex or else a stunning vantage point here. After the questing/questioning of 2009’s  and the arid landscapes of 2011’s , two albums stripped yet full of open-spaces and silences, what was left to pare down?What distinguishes  from his previous albums is nearly imperceptible. Callahan still uses the percussion of Brian Beattie, the arcing timbre of flautist of Beth Galiger, and the Cheshire Cat-like psychedelic guitar of Matt Kinsey. Callahan’s cinematographer’s (or is it a cartographer’s?) eye remains sharp; he still sings of eagles and wildlife, the contours of rivers, the pinging of winds, in much the same way that an Edu-period haikuist might perceive an interior state by gazing upon the outer world. Though did Bashō ever write about the taste of pilgrim guts?Throughout , the dominant image is of a parabola: the trajectories of javelins and arrows, of gulls and buzzards in flight and landing, the easeful touchdown of small planes, of love itself. And, arching over it all, the movement of time’s arrow. No matter the heights achieved, one must always plummet back down. But when Callahan sings, “Time itself means nothing/ But time spent with you,” there’s a sense of love within. “I always went wrong in the same place/ where the river splits towards the sea,” he sings on the song that serves as the album’s heart, “Small Plane”, finally realizing that he could instead merge into something larger. Callahan has long been indie music’s itinerant musician, but for the first time in his music, there’s also a sense of home. —Andy Beta"

""It ain't your right,"" she sneers early on overtop a tarnished, motorik beat, and you almost get the feeling that she's talking about our right to be listening in on such intimate declarations at all. A minute later, through a clenched jaw: ""I'll only warn you one time/ I've got a stilted view."" It's not just empty provocation. This record is not polite, this record does not wait for permission; reality show casting directors take note because this record. is blown-speaker, smeared-lipstick pop—would-be radio hits with that last topcoat of paint left incomplete. It's a little bit retro—""Omanko"" is jet-lagged Suicide; ""I Will"" is Blondie with overgrown roots; ""24 Hours"" is a song I am bummed John Hughes did not get to hear before he died—but its overall sensibility is undeniably 2013. The unfinished-basement textures are the work of Producer of the Moment/Most Valuable Ex-Hippos Member Ariel Reichstadt, and if it had a kindred spirit in the many things he had a hand in this year it was Charli XCX's —another record that seethed and blushed and and just felt at all times unapologetically . But  gave us the added bonus of long-delayed gratification: a brave and uncompromising artist who'd languished so long in the dentist office waiting room of the music industry finally hears her name called—and finally gets a chance to bare her fangs. ""The way I was before, I'm not her anymore,"" Ferreira surges on ""Heavy Metal Heart"", flinging off each syllable with wild abandon, like she's shaking off the last scales of old skin. —Lindsay Zoladz"
14,The Knife,Shaking the Habitual,Mute / Brille / Rabid,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Of all the ways The Knife have provoked audiences over the years—trading in sprightly synth-pop for dread-ridden electro-goth, crafting impenetrable found-sound operas about Charles Darwin, turning up at awards shows in—words have never been their weapon of choice. But on , words are what matter most. Even as it pushes the Swedish duo to uncompromising extremes (this album doesn’t so much clear the dancefloor as tear a fissure right through it), the album stands as the Knife’s most humane, compassionate work to date. It’s a concept album but, instead of thrusting its narrative upon you, it asks that you take control of your own. Throughout the 96-minute record, Karin Dreijer Andersson can be heard talking about “stories” the way Gollum talks about rings—as a precious and empowering life-source. For Karin and brother Olaf Dreijer, stories are the building blocks of history as it is told—and, conversely, the instrument through which centuries-old socio-economic power structures can be dismantled. Of course, the Knife recognize that’s a tall order for any single album, so they dutifully lead by example, bulldozing their ice-sculpted sound and reshaping it into percussive belly-dancer thrusts, extended sound-collaged drones, and hot-wired techno. But the clamor ultimately works in service to a clarity of vision, a philosophical throughline that connects the Knife to a roll call of radicals ranging from Margaret Atwood and Judith Butler to Fugazi and Salt-n-Pepa. Quoting the latter, Olaf sings, “let’s talk about gender, baby, let’s talk about you and me,” just as the nine-minute electro-punk gut-puncher “Full of Fire” comes to a sudden halt. Here, such jarring gestures signal not the end of the story, but your cue to start telling yours. —Stuart BermanThe Knife: "
13,Kurt Vile,Wakin on a Pretty Daze,Matador,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Kurt Vile gets a lot of ink for being a supremely chill, modest family man, so what could possibly inspire him to say something like,? Specifically, punk idealists who took issue with his decision to license a year-old song to Bank of America, a windfall that required no work whatsoever and allowed him to support his wife and buy better diapers for his daughter. Did Patrick Stickles not get the joke on “Puppet to the Man”? But in a more general sense, it’s a realization that gets described more tactfully throughout Vile’s masterful fourth LP, the lightbulb moment when all those old designs for life, including your own, just don’t apply to reality anymore.None of these revelations come quickly during : On the opening quasi-title track, Vile rouses himself from slumber, laughing at people and machinery who feel like anything they have to say is particularly urgent. On the album’s closer, he spends 10 minutes trying to distill a lifetime of joy and pure pain into a “Goldtone” lasting no more than a split second. In between, Vile’s music is in a wakeful, meditative state, both searching and confident in the manner of a guy who’s learned to trust his life experience rather than someone else’s pat advice. Meanwhile, his blue-collar roots are no longer the stuff of PR one-sheets in “KV Crimes”, a through the streets of Philadelphia worthy of Rocky and “Snowflakes Are Dancing”, which earns its telltale rhyme of “Springsteen” and “pristine”. It all unfolds at the pace of life itself, a virtuoso work that sounds so effortless that even a supremely chill, modest family man can’t help but testify on ""Was All Talk"", “making music is easy, watch me!” —Ian Cohen

12,Chance the Rapper,Acid Rap,self-released,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"At a passing glance of a Tumblr timeline it'd be easy to mistake Chicago's Chance the Rapper for any number of new jack blog-savvy revivalist rappers struggling their way around high-pitched Pharcyde chatter and ""93 Til Infinity"" instrumentals. And certainly the production on with its sampled nods to J Dilla and Tribe Called Quest, leans towards that sort of single-minded throwback. But as a rapper, Chance's nostalgia is immersive, not constructed. It's telling that he openly cites the influence of under-heralded West Coast crew Freestyle Fellowship, a collective that emphasized perpetual stylistic reinvention on a micro level (and provided the big bang for both Pharcyde and Souls of Mischief's elastic flows). So where the A$APs of today pick up hand-me-down and watered down cadences and beat at them repeatedly and the Joey Badasses struggle through existing patterns that are usually far above their competency level, Chance is going back to the point of origin and rebuilding the old styles from scratch. Every track here is kicked in a different cadence—usually jazzy and always frantic—and it's striking to hear that model applied by a young rapper whose raw foundational material is Kanye and Eminem. He's using the same toolbox as the greats but drawing on very different blueprints. Chance's writing takes a similarly expansive approach to history. For a 20-year-old, Chance's point of view is oddly melancholic and sentimental, but this perspective only strengthens his narratives. He writes with a vivid sensory memory—you can smell the blunt guts or hear the fireworks and mistake them for gunfire in his words. It's a paradoxically level-headed approach on an album where the performance is so unhinged and the second line is """" But maybe the title—and Chance's whole Woody Woodpecker meltdown rap style—is a bit of a misdirect. isn't about the trip, it's about the flashbacks. —Andrew Nosnitsky

11,Darkside,Psychic,Matador / Other People,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"is a declaration of psychedelic liberation. It’s the sound of lava lamps being unplugged, black light mushroom posters trashed, and wah-wah pedals pawned. It’s Nicolas Jaar and guitarist Dave Harrington re-imagining Pink Floyd if Ricardo Villalobos substituted for Syd Barrett. Leave it to a Brown graduate to elude all stoner cliché. Every college freshman to alternate bong rips and guitar riffs has vainly toyed with the conceit of updating . Most experiments wind up as morbidly embarrassing as Trustafarians with dreads.Darkside are brazen enough to lay it down flat in the title of their project. The heartbeat thump, lunar spacing, and spooky post-production clatter ring the same alarms. You hear the reverberations of 22-minute trip, “Echoes”, but they’re re-routed through a vapor trail of krautrock, trip-hop, Italo-disco, and minimal techno. If the narcotic canon was constructed for isolated journeys,  is communal, funky and loose, the by-product of ideas emerging from jams. Dave Harrington’s falsetto levitates closer to  than another brick in it. Jaar contributes the Gauloises rasp expected from a former scholar of French deconstructionism. His grooves are propulsive and his imagery is spare: paper trails on mountains, fruits on a table, wooden houses to live in, herbal palliatives sempiternal in bloom. The fear and interior bug-outs are swapped for neon-fringed skylines, meditative clarity, crowded dancefloors and empty freeways. is as cosmopolitan and refined as its Ivy League pedigree would intimate. It gets sweaty without losing its cool. It envisions an ambulatory future from a waxen past. Now someone needs to figure out what movie it syncs up best with.

10,Caribou,Our Love,Merge / City Slang,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"If you didn't know better, you might say Dan Snaith had come home. The mathematics Ph.D. from small-town Canada built a reputation as a talented musical shape-shifter through his evolution from early, humbly cast electronic releases (originally under the name Manitoba) to full-band psychedelic pop, which broadened into the headphones-oriented indie dance of 2010's  and even the outright club fare issued under his Daphni alias on 2012's . Rather than veer off in another new direction,  refines that eclectic history and concentrates it on pop's most universal, most personal theme.While 's burbling synths, dappled drum grooves, and honeyed falsetto melodies might have come to represent Caribou's comfort zone, what helps drive even the prospective sing-alongs (""Can't Do Without"", the title track) is a sense of melancholy and restraint that carry the weight of maturity; this sparingly deployed sophistication is present, too, in Owen Pallett's violin arrangements. When Snaith does step into comparatively new territory (woozy R&B, on Jessy Lanza-fronted ""Second Chance""; elements of rap, with the sampled voice on the Daphni-like ""Mars""), he retains an analogue warmth distinguishing his brand of romantic moderation from the year's more overtly futuristic minimalists. That the track actually titled ""Back Home"" happens to be a burst of synth-pop breakup drama just goes to show domestic bliss is anything but low stakes. Snaith may have gone full circle with an album centering around love, but it's no heart-shaped box. —Marc Hogan

9,Ariel Pink,Pom Pom,4AD,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"It’s often difficult to comprehend Ariel Pink’s take on life, both in his music and through his troll-like approach to interviews. The sense of confusion was only heightened on —often deliriously so, as he takes one long schizoid dash between styles and ideas, leaving you feeling like a human pinball falling into the drain at its close. It’s not unusual for his interviews to read like he’s at war with himself, appealing to be loved while defending the Westboro Baptist Church. Whether you agree with him or not, his purposeful message-jamming at least reflects the deranged path he treads through this record.There’s nothing on  Pink hasn’t tried before, but the execution is sharper, wittier, and even more touching than in the past. It’s common to approach a double album with a fear of sprawl lying in wait, but this reads as his most succinct set of songs to date, where whacked-out takes on '80s infomercials and nods to pure pop structure all feel more worked on than before. There are less loose ends leading nowhere, coupled with a greater sense of purpose and drive. Pink may know how to push all our buttons, but he’s also an intelligent songwriter whose work resonates far deeper than the superficial tactics he deploys to promote it. —Nick Neyland"
8,Todd Terje,It's Album Time,Olsen,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Todd Terje has built a career out of the soft-pedal. For example, roughly twice each year I remember that his  is a sly, Scandinavian riff on the name of New York house producer Todd Terry. It's in this context that some of the feather-light tracks on his long awaited debut, , feel not like window dressing for the big hits (""Inspector Norse"", ""Strandbar""), but rather a really gentle laugh track. The giddy adventures of imagined international playboy Preben and the thrift store Tropicalia of ""Svensk Sås"" are fitting for an album that begins with an explosion and ends with applause: curtains up, crowd hushes, ""It's Album Time!"" marquee flickers to life.The chewy center of this tootsie roll pop is ""Johnny and Mary"", Terje's collaboration with Bryan Ferry. The song arrives with a heavier heart than the rest of  and leaves a sting Terje spends the rest of  trying to salve, a reminder as to why we're doing a goofy dance in the first place. But mostly  is warm and ebullient and silly. Its festooned giddiness reminds me of Barry Manilow's , with Terje only too happy to play the hammy, inclusive music man. He writes the songs that make the whole world do little jigs in their kitchen. —Andrew Gaerig

7,Sun Kil Moon,Benji,Caldo Verde,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Mark Kozelek is a collage of uncles: Tough one minute, tender the next, filled with wisdom and haunted by regret—the kind of solitary man who seems like he wouldn’t have much to say but when he starts talking can’t seem to shut up.If there’s one image that defines , it isn’t of his cousin Carissa getting killed in an aerosol-can fire, or of him punching a childhood classmate who didn’t see it coming, but of him in line at Panera Bread. You’ve seen them there on the highway or next to strip-mall laundromats—they make sandwiches. Their logo is of a woman cradling a loaf of bread like it was a baby. Everything on the menu costs about eight dollars.We live in a great age for the diary: the more specific, the more universal; the closer I get to me, the better chance I have at reaching you. In every naked arrangement and half-mumbled line, in every digression from the amazing into the ordinary, Kozelek does the best he can to sneak up on his own life. What’s startling about his stories isn’t how tragic they are, but how easily their tragedies get swept away by everyday trivia, like the movie he saw or what he ordered for lunch. Hidden among the digressions is a quiet reminder that life goes on. Panera: it might not be what defines you, but it is where you go when you need to eat. —Mike Powell

6,Swans,To Be Kind,Mute / Young God,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Imagine, for a moment, that you never knew Michael Gira relaunched his powerhouse band Swans five years ago, or that they’d issued two great albums and toured extensively behind them in the interim. Now picture your hypothetical disappointment upon reading that their third such LP, , had cracked the Top 40 in two countries. In what kind of world would Swans, once a syndicate of pure invective and aggression, reunite to play major festivals and ostensibly soften their sound enough to become pop stars? Had Gira rewritten ""Failure"" to be called ""Success""?Relax, or actually brace yourself:  remained on ’s Top 200 for only two weeks. And the two-disc, two-hour set is one of the most unflinching achievements of Swans’ on-and-off 30-year career. The first album from Swans’ revitalization was intriguing but mostly suggestive of what was to come with , another two-disc tirade that moved between monolithic jams and sensitive comedowns. But  captures the feeling of blunt force trauma that the new Swans have created onstage nightly for the last half-decade. The 34-minute ""Bring the Sun/Toussaint L’Ouverture"" is a lashing epic of flung imprecations and sinister throb, coalescing in a coda heavier than most of the year’s best metal. ""Oxygen"" is a concise browbeater that finds Gira yammering and yelling over squealing saxophone and a rhythm section that treats the word ""rhythm"" like a punching bag. Bands often talk about struggling to capture their live energy and force in a recording studio. And reunited acts often fight to find the spark and gusto that once made them matter. Just ahead of his 60th birthday, Michael Gira helped Swans do both at once. —Grayson Haver Currin

5,Grouper,Ruins,Kranky,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"In our oversaturated digital present Grouper's 10th studio album, , stands out like a close-up whisper in a packed elevator. Recorded in 2011 on a four-track, during an artist residency in the small coastal Portuguese town of Aljezur (population 6,000), these eight songs—four with vocals, two instrumentals, two distended ambient pieces—feature Liz Harris singing along to minimal piano. Her voice is joined by crickets, frogs, rain, a pulsing heartbeat of a drum, and a microwave powering up after she'd lost electricity. It feels like a field recording of someone digging deeper into themselves, someone who keeps playing even after the lights go out.Harris has said she composed the material before and after jogs, trips to the beach, and long walks through the ruins of estates and a village, and that she was mostly alone when she did these things. The album is best experienced honoring the solitary way it was composed: it's quiet music that resonates loudly. Headphones bring out smaller details, allowing you into Harris' spare, heartsick lyrics (""Sometimes I wish/ That none of this had happened,"" ""I hear you calling and I want to go straight into the valleys of your arms and disappear there""), but you can also stand back a bit and let the sounds fill the room like an ocean breeze. And these are more than melancholic love songs. Harris has said  is ""A nod to that daily walk. Failed structures. Living in the remains of love."" She was clearly thinking deeply about someone in particular when she wrote the album, but  is also political music in that it reminds us we can absolutely unplug and live simply if we choose.These ""failed structures"" can take on various forms. There are governments and their systems, yes, and there are also the smaller ""tears [that] fall down in patterns on the window"" and eventually smear into a whole and evaporate. In the end, the saddest, most vulnerable structure is the human body—none has ever survived forever, or lasted for the ages—but  reminds us how much poetry and beauty can be found in the simplest moments before that inevitable silence. —Brandon Stosuy

4,Aphex Twin,Syro,Warp,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"Perhaps no figure in electronic music casts a heavier shadow than Richard D. James. He spent the '90s reinventing himself perpetually, trampling through aliases and existing subgenres—acid house, ambient, drum'n'bass, whatever—and emerging with strange and brilliant derivatives on a near yearly basis. So it came as a surprise (and maybe a slight disappointment) when , his first official album after 13 years of relative reclusiveness, proved to be anything  a surprise. In fact, if you had imagined a new Aphex Twin album in 2004, it probably would've sounded a lot like the one he ended up releasing in 2014. But here's the thing: Despite the incessant projections of his audience, Aphex Twin was never principally about innovation. His discography is merely a running series of genre studies, warped instinctively by a perfectionist with a bizarre creative voice.  feels like the logical culmination of these efforts, as the genre he's bending and perfecting this time is the amorphous one that he instinctively spent his career creating: a bubble-and-spazz hybrid of acid squelches, spongecake melodies, and scattershot rhythms.He's advanced this form to almost incomprehensibly complex levels, too. Apart from the mecha-Satie digestif ""aisatsana [102]"", each second of the record is so intricate, so delicately packed with moving parts that it makes just about all of his contemporaries look like amateurs by comparison. But that technical proficiency is a bit of a red herring as well. The real reason  works is because the natural joy that defined James' earliest and best works is still very palpable. His voice is his voice. —Andrew Nosnitsky"
3,The War on Drugs,Lost in the Dream,Secretly Canadian,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014," revolves around War on Drugs linchpin Adam Granduciel's personal struggles—with loneliness, depression, death. And the frontman’s weariness and dislocation is articulated not just through words but also the album’s overall sound—a sound that has often been discussed in derisive terms by non-fans averse to a contemporary album calling back to mid-'80s Springsteen, Bryan Adams, and Dire Straits. Which is all fair. But ’s indebtedness to that era and its production quirks serves a larger purpose. Between, say, 1980 and 1986, heartland rock collided with synth-heavy new wave, and the results could sometimes be awkward. But there's a terrific tension in these sorts of hybrids, a tension that this album exploits to brilliant effect.The sound of  is both ""authentic"" (guitars, acoustic instruments) and ""artificial"" (synthesizers, dewy reverb). The guitars have the wet electronic sheen of . Granduciel's voice is often processed to the point of unintelligibility. Drummer Charlie Hall is Klaus Dinger in a straw hat, keeping it steady and regular as the joints hitting the tires on I-80. Yet for all the album’s American-ness,  has a decidedly across-the-pond tinge, one eye on the highway and one gazing off at the Balearic Islands. It all meshes seamlessly to give these songs of heartbreak and loss a proper context, conveying the feeling of living inside an experience while also feeling like you're floating out there somewhere far away, watching it all happen. —Mark Richardson

2,FKA twigs,LP1,Young Turks,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"FKA twigs’  reflected the mood of its times. While there’s nothing explicitly about The World here—the centers of action on  are almost entirely corporeal—the themes of this myopically personal album echo social and cultural dramas that ran through the whole of 2014. The emotional morass, the fixed misery, the desperation for recognition, the dignifying power of love and respect, a quest for pleasure that never ebbs—twigs is pleading the modern condition, as well as her own.Nevertheless, the quiet, sensual revelations came like they were dispatched in a post-coital haze, doling directions, requests, and a map of her fantasies in percussive coos that are 85% sigh. The album orbits from bed to head and back again, though she’s often alone, giving light to the topography of her needs, nasty or otherwise. Even when she sings of being together, as on “Two Weeks”, it’s only in her brain, distilling a freaky  she is trying to put into someone else’s head; it’s certainly the slinkiest zipless fuck 2014 offered. But it’s not some baby-making you-and-me all night long love, it’s very much individuals working towards a connection that they know is doomed.And ultimately, at its sinewy, sub-bass-laced heart,  writhes in its doom. The lo-bpm R&B futurism of the production matches the album’s fixed circuit of feeling; it’s airless and without anchor, leaving space for twigs' voice between dense clouds of synthetic boom. It is a testament to her vulnerability and vision that a listen to  puts us into another world—down in the fetid depths of her depression and desire. —Jessica Hopper"
1,Run the Jewels,Run the Jewels 2,Mass Appeal,Staff Lists: The 50 Best Albums of 2014,"This is volume for the voiceless, a silver bullet for the wolves, and a redistribution of sovereignty. It’s venom to immobilize cheaply uniformed imposters, flatulent greedheads, and cynical buffoons perverting the truth on cable news. When institutions lacked authority and insurrection seemed permanently imminent, El-P and Killer Mike hurled 11 grenades, offering redemption through untrammeled rage. If justice remained elusive, retaliation could be had as fast as closing your eyes and counting to fuck.On the brimstone tablets of Run the Jewels, destruction is the first commandment. The others are equally timeless: never compromise art for the sake of temporary commerce, protect the purity of your teenaged ideals, never worship false idols, and always smoke the finest medicine. So for 38 minutes, the most scorched-earth tag team since  eviscerate crooked cops and Grand Dragons, spineless politicians and the grandly disappointing competition. It’s the middle finger in rap form, with regional differences resolved through the harmonious alienation of Pimp C’s ""fuck the law"" and Biggie’s ""fuck the world.""Anger isn’t enough. If you’re going to be a revolutionary banging on your adversaries, your adolescent convictions have to be seared with the wisdom of adulthood. Identifying targets is easy—artful rebellion on the edge of 40 isn’t. But their experience lends authority and accuracy. They’ve seen enough cycles to know that corruption can’t be cleared like clogged arteries. They seek answers that transcend gestures of momentary appeasement. As Mike bellows, you can unmask and depose Donald Sterling, but the ""man behind the man behind the man behind the throne"" remains anonymous and omnipotent.The subversive attitude extends to the production. The nitroglycerin reprisals of Public Enemy and early Ice Cube have been stripped for parts, re-assembled, and converted into lethal infernal machines. This is the modern soundtrack for sedition. Guerilla army rap. Or, in Mike’s estimation: MJG meets the Weathermen. Blast it loud enough and the roaches will wave white flags and the walls will crumble into paste.In an era when the great rap group has become an endangered species, Run the Jewels have forged a truly collaborative partnership. This feels like the by-product of two best friends bouncing ideas off each other, buoyed by blunts and the occasional fistful of psilocybin. The effect reminds you of vintage OutKast, two unique and equal talents that became indivisible—accentuating each other’s strengths, curbing each other’s excesses, and finishing each other’s jokes. Despite its Molotov politics,  doubles as a old-fashioned swaggering shit-talking rap record; they flex and banter like they’re openly gunning to be cast in a  remake.It’s been long held that discontent is the first sign of progress in a man or nation, but Killer Mike and El-P have been ornery and irate for far too long to sustain patience. Occasionally, you receive the anti-heroes you need, and this was the year when we realized how right they’ve always been. No other album distilled such unrestrained fury, nor reminded us how frustratingly little has changed. When this record’s truths become unrecognizable, we’ll know that we’ve finally made progress. We can chart our evolution from here. —Jeff Weiss

This time they searched the streets of Haiti and Jamaica and brought back rala music and reggae. They found James Murphy and mixed in disco. They dug up some Kierkegaard, whose essay titled “The Present Age” has this skeleton key passage: “…A passionate age pushes forward, establishing new things and destroying others, raising and tearing down. A reflective, passionless age does the opposite, it stifles and hinders, it levels.”Arcade Fire found their reality in this new  one of both stifling inaction and now paralytic technology—and that reality is on trial all throughout the band’s massive double album. They’ve had a referendum on disaffection since “Wake Up” and technology since “We Used to Wait”, but on it all comes to a head, mashed up in a super-saturated, kaleidoscopic double LP. One minute the rhythms plod like a 12” disco edit played at half speed, the next they explode into a carnival street party. If Arcade Fire have been accused of being too moody and mawkish in the past, this is, at last, a record that’s more for the feet and body than it is for an aching heart. They wrote their big arena songs early in their career, and they can now fill the enormous space they carved for themselves like a polyglot band, fluent in many languages—sentiment and irony, Italo disco and island syncopations, English and French—to try and balance their inflated presence on the world stage. They will never be a cool band. They will never quit these pretentious things. They keep digging tunnels, looking for that damn connector. —Jeremy D. Larson Arcade Fire: "
9,Savages,Silence Yourself,Matador / Pop Noire,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Savages are serious. If you don’t believe it from the music, there are CAPS LOCK MANIFESTOS on their Facebook and website and an earnest missive to individual identity right on the front cover of . But all that text and pretense is just static that fades to nothing when you press play on this band’s debut, which is bracing and sharp enough to cut through the noise of daily life and deliver all of the band’s messages more effectively than any of the metadata that comes with it.Savages clearly draw their most important influences from the immediate post-punk era. It’s there in Ayşe Hassan’s razor-toned bass, Fay Milton’s tight, economical drumming, and Gemma Thompson’s guitar, which swings between riffs and peals of shattering noise on a dime. Jehnny Beth’s howl has that spirit, too. But Savages are much more than just some echo of the years-ago post-punk revival; they're also a , locked in with each other, never wasting a note, and honest enough about their sound that they don’t bother with genre exercises like sneaking in a disco beat or dub passage. They cut the album in a series of live takes in the studio in the hope of capturing some of their stage show’s raw energy, and it’s a testament to their quality as a band that it’s not a gimmick. That chance to feed off each other is essential to ’s dark power.This is not an easy kind of music to make memorable, and dynamics are important to the way Savages do that. “City’s Full” and “Shut Up” seem straightforward enough at first glance, but they twist and turn in sophisticated and subtle ways that are hard for a group to master and harder to simulate when you’re recording in separate rooms. Savages may have post-punk aesthetics, but they have classic rock chops, and that matters. It makes their seriousness something to take seriously. —Joe Tangari

After a couple of small-run releases, he and Majical Cloudz partner Matthew Otto released an album called  in 2011. The Canadian duo's aesthetic back then was fairly similar to how many of their peers sound now: smooth, distant electronics with snippets of fuzzy samples, and motifs rooted in R&B and weirdo-pop alike. That same year, the pair were featured on ""Nightmusic"", a track on close friend Claire Boucher's breakout LP as Grimes, ; Welsh and Otto's contributions to the song blended in so well that it was hard to tell if they were even there at all. Considering the 10 tracks that make up , though, it's hard to imagine these guys blending into any sort of background. This is music about fear and uncertainty presented without any trace of fear and uncertainty.Any one song on  consists of a just a few warm tones along with maybe a soft backbeat or some processed guitar or strings thrown in for texture. These sounds can be inviting or chilly, sometimes simultaneously—but they can't help but feel like window dressing for Welsh's dramatic baritone, which serves as the project's nakedly emotional anchor. His words can be uncomfortably direct, breaking language down to its most basic form to communicate a message. The songs are almost invigoratingly vague; closing track ""Notebook"" sounds like a diary entry, though it's hard to tell whose diary it's from. What he says  raw, but he remains out-of-reach enough to present his and Otto's unique art as a canvas possessing all the enveloping blankness of one of Welsh's signature white T-shirts. —Larry Fitzmaurice

With , Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo provide us with an even more intimate look at their creative process, by essentially compiling a curated mix of their greatest inspirations. Except instead of simply putting together a bunch of tracks by their most beloved artists, they went out and  their idols to appear on new songs of their own.As such,  plays out like a nostalgia-trip-as-theme-park-ride, a dizzying journey through the past 40 years of pleasure-center-pushing pop. The phone-book-length liner notes list at least five iconic recording studios and a small army of veteran soft-rock session players, making the gatefold vinyl sleeve less an indulgence than a practical necessity; when you play this album on iTunes, the display may as well show all the money spent on it with each passing second. And yet, as much as the record harkens back to a bygone golden age of limitless budgets and cocaine-encrusted console boards, the utopian sonic ideal it presents—with psychedelia, prog-rock, disco, electro, indie-pop, house, and even the odd trap beat all fusing into the same blissful frequency—could only be realized today. The spare-no-expenses approach yields such an embarrassment of riches that even this summer’s most indelible are the mere crust for. But the transitions from sleek, Chic funk to theatrical orchestro-disco opuses and back feel as smooth as the station-to-station glide of a. And the luxuriant sonic details are ultimately secondary to the earworm melodies that materialize in all sorts of surprising forms: the Julian Casablancas cameo “” makes it clear that Daft Punk are better at writing latter-day Strokes songs than; the Panda Bear collab “” yields the “My Girls” sequel that  disavowed; while “” sees house producer Todd Edwards performing stellar Steely Dan karaoke in lieu of a presumably unavailable Donald Fagen. But the most illuminating insight into Daft Punk’s craft comes through the voice of perhaps their greatest influence. On the documentarian funk-fusion of “”, the Italo legend reveals the rationale behind his oft-imitated aesthetic: “I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s, the sounds of the 60s, of the 70s, and then have a sound of the future.” With , Daft Punk show that the best way to pay respects to a hero is not to merely emulate their sound, but to make their strategies your own. —Stuart Berman"
6,Deafheaven,Sunbather,Deathwish,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Drunk texts, filmic interludes, a real-time drug deal, and an obsession with money—this is neither Drake nor Kendrick, but rather Deafheaven, the California band behind one of this year's most moving rock records. On , Deafheaven radiantly fuse post-rock, shoegaze, and black metal into an aggressive swell of pastel-shaded guitars, blast beats, and confessional screams. But those mixed-in rap tropes are telling. Perhaps more than any other group making widescreen guitar music this year, Deafheaven were triumphantly post-genre. The band's approach is singular in its warm duality—a downpour of emotional energy with drama, melody, and blaring light. The sounds get under your skin like a second skeleton.The primary theme of  is a conflicted relationship with wealth—not relating to the abundance around you but still desiring the unknown. The crushing momentum of ""Dream House"" and ""Sunbather""—both symbols of all the things frontman George Clarke does not have—feels like the weight of sinking reality. But you could hear this as American Dream music, songs that struggle for a space of self-creation, because even with its harrowing themes, prioritizes a dark beauty. There are spoken-word passages, including a reading from . There are the sounds of a preacher in downtown San Francisco shouting at a crowd, projecting a most unfortunate Judgment Day. And there is also the voice of a nervous, broke Kerry McCoy, the band's guitarist and songwriter, doing a drug deal (he had been using opiates at the time). Clarke encouraged McCoy, also his best friend of over a decade, to sample the meeting; ""It's raw and soul-bearing,"" Clarke said, ""The evils of hell mixed with one's own personal hell [of] addiction and self-worth."" This is a small, street-level piece in the grand picture of , but its directness helps make everything click. For an album that can feel supernatural,  is in essence uncannily grounded. —Jenn Pelly

5,Danny Brown,Old,Fool's Gold,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"On 2011's , Danny Brown perfected one of the more compelling personae in music: an unhinged oddball with a funny haircut and a funnier voice who had an insatiable hunger for drugs and sex—and plenty of highly creative ways to tell you all about it.  was party music but it was never  party music; there was an undercurrent of darkness and danger and a little regret, even as Brown pursued his vices with gusto. Listening to it reminded me of a line on Neil Young’s album , about a hopeless junkie named Bill who was up on a hill and who was ""having a ball rolling to the bottom.""  felt like watching that tumble in action— thrilling and frightening and voyeuristic in equal measure. But the rapper on , as multi-faceted as he could be, turned out to be hiding someone even more interesting: Danny Brown. There’s still party music on , but it also includes more reflective songs. The album’s title was brave and felt like a dare: In this line of work, age usually equals death, but Brown—a virtual unknown toiling away in Detroit until he was 30, who had years away from the spotlight to practice, write, think—doesn’t shy from it. He knows that hip-hop is youth culture and wonders how to grow old within it. Not so long ago this was a purely hypothetical question because hip-hop itself was still just a baby. But the last decade we’ve seen it answered by different artists in different ways. On , this is how Danny Brown goes about it: You look back on your life and find joy and regret and pain and try and figure out what it all means. You think about where things went wrong and what you were subjected to and where you fucked up. You find collaborators to help you bring your concerns to life. You don’t let go of youthful excess and you allow yourself to do some stupid shit sometimes, to remember what it feels like, and because it’s still fun. You remember who’s important. You have some laughs. You endure. —Mark Richardson

4,My Bloody Valentine,mbv,self-released,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"We are in peak reissue/reunion culture for people who are afraid that the new will never be as good as the old. A similar fear reverberated around the world on February 2, when My Bloody Valentine let loose their first new album in 22 years. You remember where you were. You remember the 403 errors. The desperation: “hi can someone pls DM me a working link thx.” It’s just 10 months later, and the very act of downloading  feels nostalgic. That’s how fast things move now. Not for Kevin Shields, of course. That’s not his tempo.For a generation raised, drugged, and sexed on  the stakes were pretty high; for those who came into  retroactively, there was a secret hope that could be their own —a long shot. Because in 2013 is just a simulacrum, and the Gen-X’ers know that. They were there in '91 and lord that patina of authenticity over the latecomers. There’s an imprecise feeling for all who missed the introverted bliss of , and the entire microculture of shoegaze that went with it. Kids can co-opt the vibe of the 90s, but the genuine article will always be absent, drowned in the wake of time.In an unprecedented occasion,  connected the old and the new. At first, the album seemed to exist only in reference to the band’s heyday, with its monogrammed title, entirely analog recording, and mythical arrival. From the opening flourish of “She Found Now” it sounded just like a proper My Bloody Valentine record: those dropped tunings, that gated reverb, those heartbeat drums, Kevin Shields and Belinda Butcher cast once again as Ghost Who Sings 1 and Ghost Who Sings 2. But then  started to bend into the present, revealing that it wasn’t a continuation of  at all. This album is for the kid who’s home on a Friday night blowing smoke through a dryer sheet in a dorm room  the parent who’s doing the same in their home office because their child is sleeping.It’s a new blueprint for making a sexy, druggy, rock'n'roll record. These are how guitars work: They hang like tendrils for Shields and Butcher to float through, they drone imprecisely around a pitch like a bagpipe, they make harmonics that floss your equilibrium. And these are how songs go: They shift around from chord to unrelated chord just to make you dizzy, or sometimes they do nothing for three-and-a-half minutes except get a little bit louder. In just nine songs, they manage to detach from the 90s and float in the ether, there for any generation to claim as their own. —Jeremy D. LarsonMy Bloody Valentine: "
3,Disclosure,Settle,PMR,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"It felt like every time I went shopping this year, I heard a Disclosure song. There is a certain primness to  that makes the debut album from young British brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence appealing to the people who decide what you hear when you buy clothes. Every element in a Disclosure song—every click, every kick, every bubble, every —fits just so, attaining a level of tailored togetherness that is both humbling and aspirational.That delicately presented perfection could also make  too faceless to linger in your memory: A mannequin dressed like the coolest person you know is still nothing but a shiny hunk of plastic. But I frequently get completely lost in this album—in the sweep of ""Latch"", in the whispers of ""Defeated No More"", in guest vocalist Eliza Doolittle's elongated vowels, in the operatic sighs of ""Help Me Lose My Mind"".  has its own motives, but I turn to it to get sucked into the undercurrent of my own mind.Dance music has long been therapy, the dancefloor a place for redemption and salvation. But I only danced to Disclosure once this year; instead, I played this album over and over in transit—when riding the subway or walking or flying, in those rare moments when I didn't feel like I was being swallowed in noise, both literal and figurative. There, its therapeutic values remain; when I listen to , the thing I hear loudest is the space. —Jordan SargentDisclosure: "
2,Kanye West,Yeezus,Def Jam,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"Kanye West premiered ""New Slaves"" by projecting his likeness onto buildings around the world. Turns out that moderately audacious publicity stunt (by his standards) was mere foreshadowing for the riskier ambitions of , where he projects his most combative and caricatured self for 41 frenzied minutes, virtually taunting those who fail to meet him on his own terms.In turn,  increased that cohort drastically. The singles got nowhere near as much rotation as the purposefully provocative talking points. “Strange Fruit”, apartheid, and the Civil Rights sign were given new power through perversion. ""Black Skinhead"" and ""New Slaves"" dismissed nuanced political debate for righteous rage. And instead of showing gratitude for his impending fatherhood, Kanye gave us morally bankrupt songs like ""Hold My Liquor"" and ""I'm In It"" that doubled as preemptive cop-outs from any future custody battles. Since its release in June,  has been outsold by J. Cole's hedge-betting ... .Kanye might be a bit little iffy on the specifics, but there's no doubting ' thesis: There's a war going on outside, and you don't have to turn your dial too far from ""Ellen"" to see it. Both musically and politically, this album bears the strain and tension of an increasingly stratified America, one that leaves the disappearing middle class a howling void. Unlike the star-studded opus ,  is harsh and minimal, aligning itself with scavengers and subversives who accentuate Ye’s most daring impulses: Daft Punk (in taser-tag  mode), witch house wastrels Salem, Chicago drill MCs King L and Chief Keef, and cocky production innovators including Hudson Mohawke, Gesaffelstein, Young Chop, Arca, and Evian Christ.Hip-hop's fundamentally altered landscape is proof enough that Kanye constructed his perfect doomsday device with : Once “On Sight” judders to life, everything sounds radioactive, with an unpredictable blast radius that stretches past pop music—things will never be the same for croissants, Toyota Corollas, Deepak Chopra, or , to name a few. But more than anything, it ends up mutating the guy closest to it, and finds the 21st century’s most fascinating musical figure powered by poison and poisoned by power. I guess every supervillain needs his theme music. —Ian Cohen"
1,Vampire Weekend,Modern Vampires of the City,XL,Staff Lists: The Top 50 Albums of 2013,"""Ya Hey"" is, like so much of , something at once tender and impossibly grand—a break-up song about God. ""Oh, sweet thing,"" Ezra Koenig coos. ""Babylon don't love you."" Then comes an even more backhanded kiss-off: ""But you love everything."". The same could (and has) been said of Vampire Weekend, with and without the italicized sneer. Back in 2007, when their self-titled CD-R first started making its way beyond Columbia's campus, you'd have been hard-pressed to read something about them that didn't balk at their cultural omnivorousness—an Ivy League indie-pop band that name-checks Lil Jon  Peter Gabriel in the same sustained breath? Half a decade later, it is equally hard to imagine this same fact surprising anybody. As  showcases, a transformation has taken place within Vampire Weekend—they've grown into a mature, ambitious band whose music is now both airier and weightier than it used to be. But a broader cultural shift has occurred, too. The lines that used to separate different kinds of music are starting to look more and more old-fashioned, and the rigid identities by which people used to make musical taste a game of us-vs.-them are crumbling like old buildings. We are moving in the direction of a place where everybody is allowed to love everything.And the album's more lighthearted moments—the crash-pop of ""Diane Young"" or the half-rapped, harpsichord-kissed Souls of Mischief nod ""Step""—feel like an anarchic celebration of this. But there's also an unshakable sense of gravitas anchoring these songs. Multi-instrumentalist Rostam Batmanglij (who co-produced with the ubiquitous Ariel Rechtshaid) is as eloquent with atmosphere as Koenig is with words; every track on here has its own weather. The arrangements on career-to-date peaks like ""Obvious Bicycle"" and ""Hannah Hunt"" are meticulous but well-ventilated—chatter drifts in, as if through an open window, providing hazy backdrops for Koenig's lyrical searching. ""I'm not excited, but should I be?/ Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?"" a disillusioned narrator sings in ""Unbelievers"", glancing around at a shitty job market, mounting student loans, and a culture that likes to blame all its ailments on the helpless young. On , Vampire Weekend reject the narrative that has been used to describe their generation: In the clock-smashing slow-motion of ""Hannah Hunt"", somebody takes the Paper of Record—you imagine it's turned to one of those Trouble With Millennials articles—and tears it into pieces.But this record also tears up the narrative that has up until now defined Vampire Weekend.  is such an overwhelmingly humane album that it makes all those words that used to stick to them (elitist, pretentious, preppy) seem outmoded, too. Maybe what this album is really breaking up with is dogma—anything that limits the scope of your perspective and what (or who) you can love. It believes in nothing so much as this moment, speaking in pitch-shifted tongues, and finding its own heaven in the Cloud. (See next page for contributors' top 10s)"
